       "'[The Wisdom of Father Brown by G. K. Chesterton 1914]\\n\\n\\nI. The Absence of Mr Glass\\n\\n\\nTHE consulting-rooms of Dr Orion Hood, the eminent criminologist\\nand specialist in certain moral disorders, lay along the sea-front\\nat Scarborough, in a series of very large and well-lighted french windows,\\nwhich showed the North Sea like one endless outer wall of blue-green marble.\\nIn such a place the sea had something of the monotony of a blue-green dado:\\nfor the chambers themselves were ruled throughout by a terrible tidiness\\nnot unlike the terrible tidiness of the sea.  It must not be supposed\\nthat Dr Hood\\'s apartments excluded luxury, or even poetry.\\nThese things were there, in their place; but one felt that\\nthey were never allowed out of their place.  Luxury was there:\\nthere stood upon a special table eight or ten boxes of the best cigars;\\nbut they were built upon a plan so that the strongest were always\\nnearest the wall and the mildest nearest the window.  A tantalus\\ncontaining three kinds of spirit, all of a liqueur excellence,\\nstood always on this table of luxury; but the fanciful have asserted\\nthat the whisky, brandy, and rum seemed always to stand at the same level.\\nPoetry was there:  the left-hand corner of the room was lined with\\nas complete a set of English classics as the right hand could show\\nof English and foreign physiologists.  But if one took a volume\\nof Chaucer or Shelley from that rank, its absence irritated the mind\\nlike a gap in a man\\'s front teeth.  One could not say the books\\nwere never read; probably they were, but there was a sense of their\\nbeing chained to their places, like the Bibles in the old churches.\\nDr Hood treated his private book-shelf as if it were a public library.\\nAnd if this strict scientific intangibility steeped even the shelves\\nladen with lyrics and ballads and the tables laden with drink and tobacco,\\nit goes without saying that yet more of such heathen holiness\\nprotected the other shelves that held the specialist\\'s library,\\nand the other tables that sustained the frail and even fairylike\\ninstruments of chemistry or mechanics.\\n\\n     Dr Hood paced the length of his string of apartments, bounded--\\nas the boys\\' geographies say--on the east by the North Sea and on the west\\nby the serried ranks of his sociological and criminologist library.\\nHe was clad in an artist\\'s velvet, but with none of an artist\\'s negligence;\\nhis hair was heavily shot with grey, but growing thick and healthy;\\nhis face was lean, but sanguine and expectant.  Everything about him\\nand his room indicated something at once rigid and restless,\\nlike that great northern sea by which (on pure principles of hygiene)\\nhe had built his home.\\n\\n     Fate, being in a funny mood, pushed the door open and\\nintroduced into those long, strict, sea-flanked apartments\\none who was perhaps the most startling opposite of them and their master.\\nIn answer to a curt but civil summons, the door opened inwards\\nand there shambled into the room a shapeless little figure,\\nwhich seemed to find its own hat and umbrella as unmanageable as\\na mass of luggage.  The umbrella was a black and prosaic bundle\\nlong past repair; the hat was a broad-curved black hat, clerical\\nbut not common in England; the man was the very embodiment of all\\nthat is homely and helpless.\\n\\n     The doctor regarded the new-comer with a restrained astonishment,\\nnot unlike that he would have shown if some huge but obviously\\nharmless sea-beast had crawled into his room.  The new-comer\\nregarded the doctor with that beaming but breathless geniality\\nwhich characterizes a corpulent charwoman who has just managed\\nto stuff herself into an omnibus.  It is a rich confusion of\\nsocial self-congratulation and bodily disarray.  His hat tumbled\\nto the carpet, his heavy umbrella slipped between his knees with a thud;\\nhe reached after the one and ducked after the other, but with\\nan unimpaired smile on his round face spoke simultaneously as follows:\\n\\n     \"My name is Brown.  Pray excuse me.  I\\'ve come about\\nthat business of the MacNabs.  I have heard, you often help people\\nout of such troubles.  Pray excuse me if I am wrong.\"\\n\\n     By this time he had sprawlingly recovered the hat, and made\\nan odd little bobbing bow over it, as if setting everything quite right.\\n\\n     \"I hardly understand you,\" replied the scientist, with\\na cold intensity of manner.  \"I fear you have mistaken the chambers.\\nI am Dr Hood, and my work is almost entirely literary and educational.\\nIt is true that I have sometimes been consulted by the police\\nin cases of peculiar difficulty and importance, but--\"\\n\\n     \"Oh, this is of the greatest importance,\" broke in the little man\\ncalled Brown.  \"Why, her mother won\\'t let them get engaged.\"\\nAnd he leaned back in his chair in radiant rationality.\\n\\n     The brows of Dr Hood were drawn down darkly, but the eyes\\nunder them were bright with something that might be anger or\\nmight be amusement.  \"And still,\" he said, \"I do not quite understand.\"\\n\\n     \"You see, they want to get married,\" said the man with the\\nclerical hat.  \"Maggie MacNab and young Todhunter want to get married.\\nNow, what can be more important than that?\"\\n\\n     The great Orion Hood\\'s scientific triumphs had deprived him\\nof many things--some said of his health, others of his God;\\nbut they had not wholly despoiled him of his sense of the absurd.\\nAt the last plea of the ingenuous priest a chuckle broke out of him\\nfrom inside, and he threw himself into an arm-chair in an ironical attitude\\nof the consulting physician.\\n\\n     \"Mr Brown,\" he said gravely, \"it is quite fourteen and a half years\\nsince I was personally asked to test a personal problem: then it was\\nthe case of an attempt to poison the French President at\\na Lord Mayor\\'s Banquet.  It is now, I understand, a question of whether\\nsome friend of yours called Maggie is a suitable fiancee for some friend\\nof hers called Todhunter.  Well, Mr Brown, I am a sportsman.\\nI will take it on.  I will give the MacNab family my best advice,\\nas good as I gave the French Republic and the King of England--no, better:\\nfourteen years better.  I have nothing else to do this afternoon.\\nTell me your story.\"\\n\\n     The little clergyman called Brown thanked him with\\nunquestionable warmth, but still with a queer kind of simplicity.\\nIt was rather as if he were thanking a stranger in a smoking-room\\nfor some trouble in passing the matches, than as if he were (as he was)\\npractically thanking the Curator of Kew Gardens for coming with him\\ninto a field to find a four-leaved clover.  With scarcely a semi-colon\\nafter his hearty thanks, the little man began his recital:\\n\\n     \"I told you my name was Brown; well, that\\'s the fact,\\nand I\\'m the priest of the little Catholic Church I dare say you\\'ve seen\\nbeyond those straggly streets, where the town ends towards the north.\\nIn the last and straggliest of those streets which runs along the sea\\nlike a sea-wall there is a very honest but rather sharp-tempered\\nmember of my flock, a widow called MacNab.  She has one daughter,\\nand she lets lodgings, and between her and the daughter,\\nand between her and the lodgers--well, I dare say there is a great deal\\nto be said on both sides.  At present she has only one lodger,\\nthe young man called Todhunter; but he has given more trouble\\nthan all the rest, for he wants to marry the young woman of the house.\"\\n\\n     \"And the young woman of the house,\" asked Dr Hood, with huge and\\nsilent amusement, \"what does she want?\"\\n\\n     \"Why, she wants to marry him,\" cried Father Brown, sitting up eagerly.\\n\"That is just the awful complication.\"\\n\\n     \"It is indeed a hideous enigma,\" said Dr Hood.\\n\\n     \"This young James Todhunter,\" continued the cleric,\\n\"is a very decent man so far as I know; but then nobody knows very much.\\nHe is a bright, brownish little fellow, agile like a monkey,\\nclean-shaven like an actor, and obliging like a born courtier.\\nHe seems to have quite a pocketful of money, but nobody knows what\\nhis trade is.  Mrs MacNab, therefore (being of a pessimistic turn),\\nis quite sure it is something dreadful, and probably connected with dynamite.\\nThe dynamite must be of a shy and noiseless sort, for the poor fellow\\nonly shuts himself up for several hours of the day and studies something\\nbehind a locked door.  He declares his privacy is temporary and justified,\\nand promises to explain before the wedding.  That is all that anyone knows\\nfor certain, but Mrs MacNab will tell you a great deal more than\\neven she is certain of.  You know how the tales grow like grass on\\nsuch a patch of ignorance as that.  There are tales of two voices\\nheard talking in the room; though, when the door is opened,\\nTodhunter is always found alone.  There are tales of a mysterious\\ntall man in a silk hat, who once came out of the sea-mists and\\napparently out of the sea, stepping softly across the sandy fields and\\nthrough the small back garden at twilight, till he was heard\\ntalking to the lodger at his open window.  The colloquy seemed to end\\nin a quarrel.  Todhunter dashed down his window with violence,\\nand the man in the high hat melted into the sea-fog again.\\nThis story is told by the family with the fiercest mystification;\\nbut I really think Mrs MacNab prefers her own original tale:\\nthat the Other Man (or whatever it is) crawls out every night from the\\nbig box in the corner, which is kept locked all day.  You see,\\ntherefore, how this sealed door of Todhunter\\'s is treated as the gate\\nof all the fancies and monstrosities of the `Thousand and One Nights\\'.\\nAnd yet there is the little fellow in his respectable black jacket,\\nas punctual and innocent as a parlour clock.  He pays his rent to the tick;\\nhe is practically a teetotaller; he is tirelessly kind with\\nthe younger children, and can keep them amused for a day on end; and,\\nlast and most urgent of all, he has made himself equally popular with\\nthe eldest daughter, who is ready to go to church with him tomorrow.\"\\n\\n     A man warmly concerned with any large theories has always\\na relish for applying them to any triviality.  The great specialist\\nhaving condescended to the priest\\'s simplicity, condescended expansively.\\nHe settled himself with comfort in his arm-chair and began to talk in\\nthe tone of a somewhat absent-minded lecturer:\\n\\n     \"Even in a minute instance, it is best to look first to\\nthe main tendencies of Nature.  A particular flower may not be dead\\nin early winter, but the flowers are dying; a particular pebble\\nmay never be wetted with the tide, but the tide is coming in.\\nTo the scientific eye all human history is a series of collective movements,\\ndestructions or migrations, like the massacre of flies in winter\\nor the return of birds in spring.  Now the root fact in all history is Race.\\nRace produces religion; Race produces legal and ethical wars.\\nThere is no stronger case than that of the wild, unworldly and\\nperishing stock which we commonly call the Celts, of whom your friends\\nthe MacNabs are specimens.  Small, swarthy, and of this dreamy and\\ndrifting blood, they accept easily the superstitious explanation of\\nany incidents, just as they still accept (you will excuse me for saying)\\nthat superstitious explanation of all incidents which you\\nand your Church represent.  It is not remarkable that such people,\\nwith the sea moaning behind them and the Church (excuse me again)\\ndroning in front of them, should put fantastic features into what are\\nprobably plain events.  You, with your small parochial responsibilities,\\nsee only this particular Mrs MacNab, terrified with this particular tale\\nof two voices and a tall man out of the sea.  But the man with\\nthe scientific imagination sees, as it were, the whole clans of MacNab\\nscattered over the whole world, in its ultimate average as uniform\\nas a tribe of birds.  He sees thousands of Mrs MacNabs,\\nin thousands of houses, dropping their little drop of morbidity\\nin the tea-cups of their friends; he sees--\"\\n\\n     Before the scientist could conclude his sentence, another and\\nmore impatient summons sounded from without; someone with swishing skirts\\nwas marshalled hurriedly down the corridor, and the door opened on\\na young girl, decently dressed but disordered and red-hot with haste.\\nShe had sea-blown blonde hair, and would have been entirely beautiful\\nif her cheek-bones had not been, in the Scotch manner, a little\\nhigh in relief as well as in colour.  Her apology was almost as abrupt\\nas a command.\\n\\n     \"I\\'m sorry to interrupt you, sir,\" she said, \"but I had to follow\\nFather Brown at once; it\\'s nothing less than life or death.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown began to get to his feet in some disorder.\\n\"Why, what has happened, Maggie?\" he said.\\n\\n     \"James has been murdered, for all I can make out,\"\\nanswered the girl, still breathing hard from her rush.  \"That man Glass\\nhas been with him again; I heard them talking through the door quite plain.\\nTwo separate voices:  for James speaks low, with a burr,\\nand the other voice was high and quavery.\"\\n\\n     \"That man Glass?\" repeated the priest in some perplexity.\\n\\n     \"I know his name is Glass,\" answered the girl, in great impatience.\\n\"I heard it through the door.  They were quarrelling--about money,\\nI think--for I heard James say again and again, `That\\'s right, Mr Glass,\\'\\nor `No, Mr Glass,\\' and then, `Two or three, Mr Glass.\\'  But we\\'re talking\\ntoo much; you must come at once, and there may be time yet.\"\\n\\n     \"But time for what?\" asked Dr Hood, who had been studying\\nthe young lady with marked interest.  \"What is there about Mr Glass\\nand his money troubles that should impel such urgency?\"\\n\\n     \"I tried to break down the door and couldn\\'t,\" answered the girl shortly,\\n\"Then I ran to the back-yard, and managed to climb on to the window-sill\\nthat looks into the room.  It was an dim, and seemed to be empty,\\nbut I swear I saw James lying huddled up in a corner, as if he were\\ndrugged or strangled.\"\\n\\n     \"This is very serious,\" said Father Brown, gathering his errant hat\\nand umbrella and standing up; \"in point of fact I was just putting\\nyour case before this gentleman, and his view--\"\\n\\n     \"Has been largely altered,\" said the scientist gravely.\\n\"I do not think this young lady is so Celtic as I had supposed.\\nAs I have nothing else to do, I will put on my hat and stroll\\ndown town with you.\"\\n\\n     In a few minutes all three were approaching the dreary tail of\\nthe MacNabs\\' street:  the girl with the stern and breathless stride\\nof the mountaineer, the criminologist with a lounging grace (which was\\nnot without a certain leopard-like swiftness), and the priest at an\\nenergetic trot entirely devoid of distinction.  The aspect of this\\nedge of the town was not entirely without justification for\\nthe doctor\\'s hints about desolate moods and environments.\\nThe scattered houses stood farther and farther apart in a broken string\\nalong the seashore; the afternoon was closing with a premature and\\npartly lurid twilight; the sea was of an inky purple and murmuring ominously.\\nIn the scrappy back garden of the MacNabs which ran down towards the sand,\\ntwo black, barren-looking trees stood up like demon hands held up\\nin astonishment, and as Mrs MacNab ran down the street to meet them\\nwith lean hands similarly spread, and her fierce face in shadow,\\nshe was a little like a demon herself.  The doctor and the priest\\nmade scant reply to her shrill reiterations of her daughter\\'s story,\\nwith more disturbing details of her own, to the divided vows of vengeance\\nagainst Mr Glass for murdering, and against Mr Todhunter for being murdered,\\nor against the latter for having dared to want to marry her daughter,\\nand for not having lived to do it.  They passed through the narrow passage\\nin the front of the house until they came to the lodger\\'s door at the back,\\nand there Dr Hood, with the trick of an old detective, put his shoulder\\nsharply to the panel and burst in the door.\\n\\n     It opened on a scene of silent catastrophe.  No one seeing it,\\neven for a flash, could doubt that the room had been the theatre\\nof some thrilling collision between two, or perhaps more, persons.\\nPlaying-cards lay littered across the table or fluttered about\\nthe floor as if a game had been interrupted.  Two wine glasses stood\\nready for wine on a side-table, but a third lay smashed\\nin a star of crystal upon the carpet.  A few feet from it lay\\nwhat looked like a long knife or short sword, straight,\\nbut with an ornamental and pictured handle, its dull blade just caught\\na grey glint from the dreary window behind, which showed the black trees\\nagainst the leaden level of the sea.  Towards the opposite corner\\nof the room was rolled a gentleman\\'s silk top hat, as if it had\\njust been knocked off his head; so much so, indeed, that one almost looked\\nto see it still rolling.  And in the corner behind it, thrown like a sack\\nof potatoes, but corded like a railway trunk, lay Mr James Todhunter,\\nwith a scarf across his mouth, and six or seven ropes knotted round\\nhis elbows and ankles.  His brown eyes were alive and shifted alertly.\\n\\n     Dr Orion Hood paused for one instant on the doormat and drank in\\nthe whole scene of voiceless violence.  Then he stepped swiftly\\nacross the carpet, picked up the tall silk hat, and gravely put it\\nupon the head of the yet pinioned Todhunter.  It was so much too large\\nfor him that it almost slipped down on to his shoulders.\\n\\n     \"Mr Glass\\'s hat,\" said the doctor, returning with it and peering\\ninto the inside with a pocket lens.  \"How to explain the absence\\nof Mr Glass and the presence of Mr Glass\\'s hat?  For Mr Glass is not a\\ncareless man with his clothes.  That hat is of a stylish shape and\\nsystematically brushed and burnished, though not very new.\\nAn old dandy, I should think.\"\\n\\n     \"But, good heavens!\" called out Miss MacNab, \"aren\\'t you going to\\nuntie the man first?\"\\n\\n     \"I say `old\\' with intention, though not with certainty\"\\ncontinued the expositor; \"my reason for it might seem a little far-fetched.\\nThe hair of human beings falls out in very varying degrees,\\nbut almost always falls out slightly, and with the lens I should see\\nthe tiny hairs in a hat recently worn.  It has none, which leads me\\nto guess that Mr Glass is bald.  Now when this is taken with\\nthe high-pitched and querulous voice which Miss MacNab described\\nso vividly (patience, my dear lady, patience), when we take\\nthe hairless head together with the tone common in senile anger,\\nI should think we may deduce some advance in years.  Nevertheless,\\nhe was probably vigorous, and he was almost certainly tall.\\nI might rely in some degree on the story of his previous appearance\\nat the window, as a tall man in a silk hat, but I think I have\\nmore exact indication.  This wineglass has been smashed all over the place,\\nbut one of its splinters lies on the high bracket beside the mantelpiece.\\nNo such fragment could have fallen there if the vessel had been smashed\\nin the hand of a comparatively short man like Mr Todhunter.\"\\n\\n     \"By the way,\" said Father Brown, \"might it not be as well\\nto untie Mr Todhunter?\"\\n\\n     \"Our lesson from the drinking-vessels does not end here,\"\\nproceeded the specialist.  \"I may say at once that it is possible\\nthat the man Glass was bald or nervous through dissipation rather than age.\\nMr Todhunter, as has been remarked, is a quiet thrifty gentleman,\\nessentially an abstainer.  These cards and wine-cups are no part\\nof his normal habit; they have been produced for a particular companion.\\nBut, as it happens, we may go farther.  Mr Todhunter may or may not\\npossess this wine-service, but there is no appearance of his\\npossessing any wine.  What, then, were these vessels to contain?\\nI would at once suggest some brandy or whisky, perhaps of a luxurious sort,\\nfrom a flask in the pocket of Mr Glass.  We have thus something like\\na picture of the man, or at least of the type:  tall, elderly, fashionable,\\nbut somewhat frayed, certainly fond of play and strong waters,\\nperhaps rather too fond of them Mr Glass is a gentleman not unknown\\non the fringes of society.\"\\n\\n     \"Look here,\" cried the young woman, \"if you don\\'t let me pass to\\nuntie him I\\'ll run outside and scream for the police.\"\\n\\n     \"I should not advise you, Miss MacNab,\" said Dr Hood gravely,\\n\"to be in any hurry to fetch the police.  Father Brown,\\nI seriously ask you to compose your flock, for their sakes, not for mine.\\nWell, we have seen something of the figure and quality of Mr Glass;\\nwhat are the chief facts known of Mr Todhunter?  They are substantially three:\\nthat he is economical, that he is more or less wealthy, and that\\nhe has a secret.  Now, surely it is obvious that there are\\nthe three chief marks of the kind of man who is blackmailed.\\nAnd surely it is equally obvious that the faded finery,\\nthe profligate habits, and the shrill irritation of Mr Glass\\nare the unmistakable marks of the kind of man who blackmails him.\\nWe have the two typical figures of a tragedy of hush money:\\non the one hand, the respectable man with a mystery; on the other,\\nthe West-end vulture with a scent for a mystery.  These two men\\nhave met here today and have quarrelled, using blows and a bare weapon.\"\\n\\n     \"Are you going to take those ropes off?\" asked the girl stubbornly.\\n\\n     Dr Hood replaced the silk hat carefully on the side table,\\nand went across to the captive.  He studied him intently,\\neven moving him a little and half-turning him round by the shoulders,\\nbut he only answered:\\n\\n     \"No; I think these ropes will do very well till your friends\\nthe police bring the handcuffs.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown, who had been looking dully at the carpet,\\nlifted his round face and said:  \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n     The man of science had picked up the peculiar dagger-sword\\nfrom the carpet and was examining it intently as he answered:\\n\\n     \"Because you find Mr Todhunter tied up,\" he said, \"you all jump\\nto the conclusion that Mr Glass had tied him up; and then, I suppose,\\nescaped.  There are four objections to this: First, why should a gentleman\\nso dressy as our friend Glass leave his hat behind him, if he left\\nof his own free will? Second,\" he continued, moving towards the window,\\n\"this is the only exit, and it is locked on the inside.  Third, this\\nblade here has a tiny touch of blood at the point, but there is\\nno wound on Mr Todhunter.  Mr Glass took that wound away with him,\\ndead or alive.  Add to all this primary probability.\\nIt is much more likely that the blackmailed person would try to kill\\nhis incubus, rather than that the blackmailer would try to kill\\nthe goose that lays his golden egg.  There, I think, we have\\na pretty complete story.\"\\n\\n     \"But the ropes?\" inquired the priest, whose eyes had remained\\nopen with a rather vacant admiration.\\n\\n     \"Ah, the ropes,\" said the expert with a singular intonation.\\n\"Miss MacNab very much wanted to know why I did not set Mr Todhunter\\nfree from his ropes.  Well, I will tell her.  I did not do it because\\nMr Todhunter can set himself free from them at any minute he chooses.\"\\n\\n     \"What?\" cried the audience on quite different notes of astonishment.\\n\\n     \"I have looked at all the knots on Mr Todhunter,\" reiterated Hood\\nquietly.  \"I happen to know something about knots; they are quite\\na branch of criminal science.  Every one of those knots he has\\nmade himself and could loosen himself; not one of them would have been made\\nby an enemy really trying to pinion him.  The whole of this affair\\nof the ropes is a clever fake, to make us think him the victim of\\nthe struggle instead of the wretched Glass, whose corpse may be hidden\\nin the garden or stuffed up the chimney.\"\\n\\n     There was a rather depressed silence; the room was darkening,\\nthe sea-blighted boughs of the garden trees looked leaner and\\nblacker than ever, yet they seemed to have come nearer to the window.\\nOne could almost fancy they were sea-monsters like krakens or cuttlefish,\\nwrithing polypi who had crawled up from the sea to see the end\\nof this tragedy, even as he, the villain and victim of it,\\nthe terrible man in the tall hat, had once crawled up from the sea.\\nFor the whole air was dense with the morbidity of blackmail, which is\\nthe most morbid of human things, because it is a crime concealing a crime;\\na black plaster on a blacker wound.\\n\\n     The face of the little Catholic priest, which was commonly complacent\\nand even comic, had suddenly become knotted with a curious frown.\\nIt was not the blank curiosity of his first innocence.  It was rather\\nthat creative curiosity which comes when a man has the beginnings of\\nan idea.  \"Say it again, please,\" he said in a simple, bothered manner;\\n\"do you mean that Todhunter can tie himself up all alone and\\nuntie himself all alone?\"\\n\\n     \"That is what I mean,\" said the doctor.\\n\\n     \"Jerusalem!\"  ejaculated Brown suddenly, \"I wonder if it could\\npossibly be that!\"\\n\\n     He scuttled across the room rather like a rabbit, and peered with\\nquite a new impulsiveness into the partially-covered face of the captive.\\nThen he turned his own rather fatuous face to the company.\\n\"Yes, that\\'s it!\" he cried in a certain excitement.  \"Can\\'t you see it\\nin the man\\'s face?  Why, look at his eyes!\"\\n\\n     Both the Professor and the girl followed the direction of his glance.\\nAnd though the broad black scarf completely masked the lower half\\nof Todhunter\\'s visage, they did grow conscious of something struggling\\nand intense about the upper part of it.\\n\\n     \"His eyes do look queer,\" cried the young woman, strongly moved.\\n\"You brutes; I believe it\\'s hurting him!\"\\n\\n     \"Not that, I think,\" said Dr Hood; \"the eyes have certainly\\na singular expression.  But I should interpret those transverse\\nwrinkles as expressing rather such slight psychological abnormality--\"\\n\\n     \"Oh, bosh!\" cried Father Brown:  \"can\\'t you see he\\'s laughing?\"\\n\\n     \"Laughing!\" repeated the doctor, with a start; \"but what on earth\\ncan he be laughing at?\"\\n\\n     \"Well,\" replied the Reverend Brown apologetically,\\n\"not to put too fine a point on it, I think he is laughing at you.\\nAnd indeed, I\\'m a little inclined to laugh at myself, now I know about it.\"\\n\\n     \"Now you know about what?\" asked Hood, in some exasperation.\\n\\n     \"Now I know,\" replied the priest, \"the profession of Mr Todhunter.\"\\n\\n     He shuffled about the room, looking at one object after another\\nwith what seemed to be a vacant stare, and then invariably bursting\\ninto an equally vacant laugh, a highly irritating process for those\\nwho had to watch it.  He laughed very much over the hat,\\nstill more uproariously over the broken glass, but the blood on\\nthe sword point sent him into mortal convulsions of amusement.\\nThen he turned to the fuming specialist.\\n\\n     \"Dr Hood,\" he cried enthusiastically, \"you are a great poet!\\nYou have called an uncreated being out of the void.  How much more godlike\\nthat is than if you had only ferreted out the mere facts!\\nIndeed, the mere facts are rather commonplace and comic by comparison.\"\\n\\n     \"I have no notion what you are talking about,\" said Dr Hood\\nrather haughtily; \"my facts are all inevitable, though necessarily incomplete.\\nA place may be permitted to intuition, perhaps (or poetry if you\\nprefer the term), but only because the corresponding details cannot\\nas yet be ascertained.  In the absence of Mr Glass--\"\\n\\n     \"That\\'s it, that\\'s it,\" said the little priest, nodding quite eagerly,\\n\"that\\'s the first idea to get fixed; the absence of Mr Glass.\\nHe is so extremely absent.  I suppose,\" he added reflectively,\\n\"that there was never anybody so absent as Mr Glass.\"\\n\\n     \"Do you mean he is absent from the town?\" demanded the doctor.\\n\\n     \"I mean he is absent from everywhere,\" answered Father Brown;\\n\"he is absent from the Nature of Things, so to speak.\"\\n\\n     \"Do you seriously mean,\" said the specialist with a smile,\\n\"that there is no such person?\"\\n\\n     The priest made a sign of assent.  \"It does seem a pity,\" he said.\\n\\n     Orion Hood broke into a contemptuous laugh.  \"Well,\" he said,\\n\"before we go on to the hundred and one other evidences, let us take\\nthe first proof we found; the first fact we fell over when we fell\\ninto this room.  If there is no Mr Glass, whose hat is this?\"\\n\\n     \"It is Mr Todhunter\\'s,\" replied Father Brown.\\n\\n     \"But it doesn\\'t fit him,\" cried Hood impatiently.  \"He couldn\\'t\\npossibly wear it!\"\\n\\n     Father Brown shook his head with ineffable mildness.\\n\"I never said he could wear it,\" he answered.  \"I said it was his hat.\\nOr, if you insist on a shade of difference, a hat that is his.\"\\n\\n     \"And what is the shade of difference?\" asked the criminologist\\nwith a slight sneer.\\n\\n     \"My good sir,\" cried the mild little man, with his first movement\\nakin to impatience, \"if you will walk down the street to the nearest\\nhatter\\'s shop, you will see that there is, in common speech,\\na difference between a man\\'s hat and the hats that are his.\"\\n\\n     \"But a hatter,\" protested Hood, \"can get money out of his\\nstock of new hats.  What could Todhunter get out of this one old hat?\"\\n\\n     \"Rabbits,\" replied Father Brown promptly.\\n\\n     \"What?\" cried Dr Hood.\\n\\n     \"Rabbits, ribbons, sweetmeats, goldfish, rolls of coloured paper,\"\\nsaid the reverend gentleman with rapidity.  \"Didn\\'t you see it all\\nwhen you found out the faked ropes?  It\\'s just the same with the sword.\\nMr Todhunter hasn\\'t got a scratch on him, as you say; but he\\'s got\\na scratch in him, if you follow me.\"\\n\\n     \"Do you mean inside Mr Todhunter\\'s clothes?\" inquired\\nMrs MacNab sternly.\\n\\n     \"I do not mean inside Mr Todhunter\\'s clothes,\" said Father Brown.\\n\"I mean inside Mr Todhunter.\"\\n\\n     \"Well, what in the name of Bedlam do you mean?\"\\n\\n     \"Mr Todhunter,\" explained Father Brown placidly, \"is learning\\nto be a professional conjurer, as well as juggler, ventriloquist,\\nand expert in the rope trick.  The conjuring explains the hat.\\nIt is without traces of hair, not because it is worn by\\nthe prematurely bald Mr Glass, but because it has never been worn\\nby anybody.  The juggling explains the three glasses, which Todhunter\\nwas teaching himself to throw up and catch in rotation.\\nBut, being only at the stage of practice, he smashed one glass\\nagainst the ceiling.  And the juggling also explains the sword,\\nwhich it was Mr Todhunter\\'s professional pride and duty to swallow.\\nBut, again, being at the stage of practice, he very slightly grazed\\nthe inside of his throat with the weapon.  Hence he has a wound\\ninside him, which I am sure (from the expression on his face)\\nis not a serious one.  He was also practising the trick of\\na release from ropes, like the Davenport Brothers, and he was just about\\nto free himself when we all burst into the room.  The cards, of course,\\nare for card tricks, and they are scattered on the floor because\\nhe had just been practising one of those dodges of sending them\\nflying through the air.  He merely kept his trade secret,\\nbecause he had to keep his tricks secret, like any other conjurer.\\nBut the mere fact of an idler in a top hat having once looked in\\nat his back window, and been driven away by him with great indignation,\\nwas enough to set us all on a wrong track of romance, and make us imagine\\nhis whole life overshadowed by the silk-hatted spectre of Mr Glass.\"\\n\\n     \"But What about the two voices?\" asked Maggie, staring.\\n\\n     \"Have you never heard a ventriloquist?\" asked Father Brown.\\n\"Don\\'t you know they speak first in their natural voice, and then\\nanswer themselves in just that shrill, squeaky, unnatural voice\\nthat you heard?\"\\n\\n     There was a long silence, and Dr Hood regarded the little man\\nwho had spoken with a dark and attentive smile.  \"You are certainly\\na very ingenious person,\" he said; \"it could not have been done better\\nin a book.  But there is just one part of Mr Glass you have not succeeded\\nin explaining away, and that is his name.  Miss MacNab distinctly\\nheard him so addressed by Mr Todhunter.\"\\n\\n     The Rev.  Mr Brown broke into a rather childish giggle.\\n\"Well, that,\" he said, \"that\\'s the silliest part of the whole silly story.\\nWhen our juggling friend here threw up the three glasses in turn,\\nhe counted them aloud as he caught them, and also commented aloud\\nwhen he failed to catch them.  What he really said was:  `One, two\\nand three--missed a glass one, two--missed a glass.\\'  And so on.\"\\n\\n     There was a second of stillness in the room, and then everyone\\nwith one accord burst out laughing.  As they did so the figure\\nin the corner complacently uncoiled all the ropes and let them fall\\nwith a flourish.  Then, advancing into the middle of the room with a bow,\\nhe produced from his pocket a big bill printed in blue and red,\\nwhich announced that ZALADIN, the World\\'s Greatest Conjurer,\\nContortionist, Ventriloquist and Human Kangaroo would be ready\\nwith an entirely new series of Tricks at the Empire Pavilion,\\nScarborough, on Monday next at eight o\\'clock precisely.\\n\\n\\n\\nII. The Paradise of Thieves\\n\\n\\nTHE great Muscari, most original of the young Tuscan poets,\\nwalked swiftly into his favourite restaurant, which overlooked\\nthe Mediterranean, was covered by an awning and fenced by little lemon\\nand orange trees.  Waiters in white aprons were already laying out\\non white tables the insignia of an early and elegant lunch;\\nand this seemed to increase a satisfaction that already touched\\nthe top of swagger.  Muscari had an eagle nose like Dante;\\nhis hair and neckerchief were dark and flowing; he carried a black cloak,\\nand might almost have carried a black mask, so much did he bear with him\\na sort of Venetian melodrama.  He acted as if a troubadour had still\\na definite social office, like a bishop.  He went as near as\\nhis century permitted to walking the world literally like Don Juan,\\nwith rapier and guitar.\\n\\n     For he never travelled without a case of swords, with which\\nhe had fought many brilliant duels, or without a corresponding case\\nfor his mandolin, with which he had actually serenaded Miss Ethel Harrogate,\\nthe highly conventional daughter of a Yorkshire banker on a holiday.\\nYet he was neither a charlatan nor a child; but a hot, logical Latin\\nwho liked a certain thing and was it.  His poetry was as straightforward\\nas anyone else\\'s prose.  He desired fame or wine or the beauty of women\\nwith a torrid directness inconceivable among the cloudy ideals\\nor cloudy compromises of the north; to vaguer races his intensity\\nsmelt of danger or even crime.  Like fire or the sea, he was too simple\\nto be trusted.\\n\\n     The banker and his beautiful English daughter were staying\\nat the hotel attached to Muscari\\'s restaurant; that was why it was\\nhis favourite restaurant.  A glance flashed around the room\\ntold him at once, however, that the English party had not descended.\\nThe restaurant was glittering, but still comparatively empty.\\nTwo priests were talking at a table in a corner, but Muscari\\n(an ardent Catholic) took no more notice of them than of a couple of crows.\\nBut from a yet farther seat, partly concealed behind a dwarf tree\\ngolden with oranges, there rose and advanced towards the poet a person\\nwhose costume was the most aggressively opposite to his own.\\n\\n     This figure was clad in tweeds of a piebald check, with a pink tie,\\na sharp collar and protuberant yellow boots.  He contrived,\\nin the true tradition of \\'Arry at Margate, to look at once startling\\nand commonplace.  But as the Cockney apparition drew nearer,\\nMuscari was astounded to observe that the head was distinctly\\ndifferent from the body.  It was an Italian head: fuzzy, swarthy and\\nvery vivacious, that rose abruptly out of the standing collar\\nlike cardboard and the comic pink tie.  In fact it was a head he knew.\\nHe recognized it, above all the dire erection of English holiday array,\\nas the face of an old but forgotten friend name Ezza.  This youth\\nhad been a prodigy at college, and European fame was promised him\\nwhen he was barely fifteen; but when he appeared in the world he failed,\\nfirst publicly as a dramatist and a demagogue, and then privately\\nfor years on end as an actor, a traveller, a commission agent\\nor a journalist.  Muscari had known him last behind the footlights;\\nhe was but too well attuned to the excitements of that profession,\\nand it was believed that some moral calamity had swallowed him up.\\n\\n     \"Ezza!\" cried the poet, rising and shaking hands in\\na pleasant astonishment.  \"Well, I\\'ve seen you in many costumes\\nin the green room; but I never expected to see you dressed up\\nas an Englishman.\"\\n\\n     \"This,\" answered Ezza gravely, \"is not the costume of an Englishman,\\nbut of the Italian of the future.\"\\n\\n     \"In that case,\" remarked Muscari, \"I confess I prefer\\nthe Italian of the past.\"\\n\\n     \"That is your old mistake, Muscari,\" said the man in tweeds,\\nshaking his head; \"and the mistake of Italy.  In the sixteenth century\\nwe Tuscans made the morning:  we had the newest steel, the newest carving,\\nthe newest chemistry.  Why should we not now have the newest factories,\\nthe newest motors, the newest finance--the newest clothes?\"\\n\\n     \"Because they are not worth having,\" answered Muscari.\\n\"You cannot make Italians really progressive; they are too intelligent.\\nMen who see the short cut to good living will never go by\\nthe new elaborate roads.\"\\n\\n     \"Well, to me Marconi, or D\\'Annunzio, is the star of Italy\"\\nsaid the other.  \"That is why I have become a Futurist--and a courier.\"\\n\\n     \"A courier!\" cried Muscari, laughing.  \"Is that the last of your\\nlist of trades?  And whom are you conducting?\"\\n\\n     \"Oh, a man of the name of Harrogate, and his family, I believe.\"\\n\\n     \"Not the banker in this hotel?\" inquired the poet,\\nwith some eagerness.\\n\\n     \"That\\'s the man,\" answered the courier.\\n\\n     \"Does it pay well?\" asked the troubadour innocently.\\n\\n     \"It will pay me,\" said Ezza, with a very enigmatic smile.\\n\"But I am a rather curious sort of courier.\"  Then, as if\\nchanging the subject, he said abruptly:  \"He has a daughter--and a son.\"\\n\\n     \"The daughter is divine,\" affirmed Muscari, \"the father and son are,\\nI suppose, human.  But granted his harmless qualities doesn\\'t that banker\\nstrike you as a splendid instance of my argument?  Harrogate has millions\\nin his safes, and I have--the hole in my pocket.  But you daren\\'t say--\\nyou can\\'t say--that he\\'s cleverer than I, or bolder than I, or even\\nmore energetic.  He\\'s not clever, he\\'s got eyes like blue buttons;\\nhe\\'s not energetic, he moves from chair to chair like a paralytic.\\nHe\\'s a conscientious, kindly old blockhead; but he\\'s got money simply\\nbecause he collects money, as a boy collects stamps.\\nYou\\'re too strong-minded for business, Ezza.  You won\\'t get on.\\nTo be clever enough to get all that money, one must be stupid enough\\nto want it.\"\\n\\n     \"I\\'m stupid enough for that,\" said Ezza gloomily.  \"But I should\\nsuggest a suspension of your critique of the banker, for here he comes.\"\\n\\n     Mr Harrogate, the great financier, did indeed enter the room,\\nbut nobody looked at him.  He was a massive elderly man with\\na boiled blue eye and faded grey-sandy moustaches; but for\\nhis heavy stoop he might have been a colonel.  He carried several\\nunopened letters in his hand.  His son Frank was a really fine lad,\\ncurly-haired, sun-burnt and strenuous; but nobody looked at him either.\\nAll eyes, as usual, were riveted, for the moment at least,\\nupon Ethel Harrogate, whose golden Greek head and colour of the dawn\\nseemed set purposely above that sapphire sea, like a goddess\\'s.\\nThe poet Muscari drew a deep breath as if he were drinking something,\\nas indeed he was.  He was drinking the Classic; which his fathers made.\\nEzza studied her with a gaze equally intense and far more baffling.\\n\\n     Miss Harrogate was specially radiant and ready for conversation\\non this occasion; and her family had fallen into the easier\\nContinental habit, allowing the stranger Muscari and even\\nthe courier Ezza to share their table and their talk.  In Ethel Harrogate\\nconventionality crowned itself with a perfection and splendour of its own.\\nProud of her father\\'s prosperity, fond of fashionable pleasures,\\na fond daughter but an arrant flirt, she was all these things with\\na sort of golden good-nature that made her very pride pleasing\\nand her worldly respectability a fresh and hearty thing.\\n\\n     They were in an eddy of excitement about some alleged peril\\nin the mountain path they were to attempt that week.  The danger was\\nnot from rock and avalanche, but from something yet more romantic.\\nEthel had been earnestly assured that brigands, the true cut-throats\\nof the modern legend, still haunted that ridge and held that pass\\nof the Apennines.\\n\\n     \"They say,\" she cried, with the awful relish of a schoolgirl,\\n\"that all that country isn\\'t ruled by the King of Italy, but by\\nthe King of Thieves.  Who is the King of Thieves?\"\\n\\n     \"A great man,\" replied Muscari, \"worthy to rank with\\nyour own Robin Hood, signorina.  Montano, the King of Thieves,\\nwas first heard of in the mountains some ten years ago, when people\\nsaid brigands were extinct.  But his wild authority spread with\\nthe swiftness of a silent revolution.  Men found his fierce proclamations\\nnailed in every mountain village; his sentinels, gun in hand,\\nin every mountain ravine.  Six times the Italian Government\\ntried to dislodge him, and was defeated in six pitched battles\\nas if by Napoleon.\"\\n\\n     \"Now that sort of thing,\" observed the banker weightily,\\n\"would never be allowed in England; perhaps, after all, we had better\\nchoose another route.  But the courier thought it perfectly safe.\"\\n\\n     \"It is perfectly safe,\" said the courier contemptuously.\\n\"I have been over it twenty times.  There may have been some old\\njailbird called a King in the time of our grandmothers;\\nbut he belongs to history if not to fable.  Brigandage is utterly\\nstamped out.\"\\n\\n     \"It can never be utterly stamped out,\" Muscari answered;\\n\"because armed revolt is a recreation natural to southerners.\\nOur peasants are like their mountains, rich in grace and green gaiety,\\nbut with the fires beneath.  There is a point of human despair where\\nthe northern poor take to drink--and our own poor take to daggers.\"\\n\\n     \"A poet is privileged,\" replied Ezza, with a sneer.\\n\"If Signor Muscari were English be would still be looking\\nfor highwaymen in Wandsworth.  Believe me, there is no more danger\\nof being captured in Italy than of being scalped in Boston.\"\\n\\n     \"Then you propose to attempt it?\" asked Mr Harrogate, frowning.\\n\\n     \"Oh, it sounds rather dreadful,\" cried the girl, turning her\\nglorious eyes on Muscari.  \"Do you really think the pass is dangerous?\"\\n\\n     Muscari threw back his black mane.  \"I know it is dangerous:\"\\nhe said.  \"I am crossing it tomorrow.\"\\n\\n     The young Harrogate was left behind for a moment emptying a glass of\\nwhite wine and lighting a cigarette, as the beauty retired with the banker,\\nthe courier and the poet, distributing peals of silvery satire.\\nAt about the same instant the two priests in the corner rose;\\nthe taller, a white-haired Italian, taking his leave.  The shorter priest\\nturned and walked towards the banker\\'s son, and the latter was astonished\\nto realize that though a Roman priest the man was an Englishman.\\nHe vaguely remembered meeting him at the social crushes of some of\\nhis Catholic friends.  But the man spoke before his memories could\\ncollect themselves.\\n\\n     \"Mr Frank Harrogate, I think,\" he said.  \"I have had an introduction,\\nbut I do not mean to presume on it.  The odd thing I have to say\\nwill come far better from a stranger.  Mr Harrogate, I say one word and go:\\ntake care of your sister in her great sorrow.\"\\n\\n     Even for Frank\\'s truly fraternal indifference the radiance\\nand derision of his sister still seemed to sparkle and ring;\\nhe could hear her laughter still from the garden of the hotel,\\nand he stared at his sombre adviser in puzzledom.\\n\\n     \"Do you mean the brigands?\" he asked; and then, remembering\\na vague fear of his own, \"or can you be thinking of Muscari?\"\\n\\n     \"One is never thinking of the real sorrow,\" said the strange priest.\\n\"One can only be kind when it comes.\"\\n\\n     And he passed promptly from the room, leaving the other almost\\nwith his mouth open.\\n\\n     A day or two afterwards a coach containing the company was\\nreally crawling and staggering up the spurs of the menacing mountain range.\\nBetween Ezza\\'s cheery denial of the danger and Muscari\\'s boisterous\\ndefiance of it, the financial family were firm in their original purpose;\\nand Muscari made his mountain journey coincide with theirs.\\nA more surprising feature was the appearance at the coast-town station\\nof the little priest of the restaurant; he alleged merely\\nthat business led him also to cross the mountains of the midland.\\nBut young Harrogate could not but connect his presence with\\nthe mystical fears and warnings of yesterday.\\n\\n     The coach was a kind of commodious wagonette, invented by\\nthe modernist talent of the courier, who dominated the expedition\\nwith his scientific activity and breezy wit.  The theory of danger from\\nthieves was banished from thought and speech; though so far conceded\\nin formal act that some slight protection was employed.  The courier\\nand the young banker carried loaded revolvers, and Muscari\\n(with much boyish gratification) buckled on a kind of cutlass\\nunder his black cloak.\\n\\n     He had planted his person at a flying leap next to\\nthe lovely Englishwoman; on the other side of her sat the priest,\\nwhose name was Brown and who was fortunately a silent individual;\\nthe courier and the father and son were on the banc behind.\\nMuscari was in towering spirits, seriously believing in the peril,\\nand his talk to Ethel might well have made her think him a maniac.\\nBut there was something in the crazy and gorgeous ascent,\\namid crags like peaks loaded with woods like orchards, that dragged\\nher spirit up alone with his into purple preposterous heavens\\nwith wheeling suns.  The white road climbed like a white cat;\\nit spanned sunless chasms like a tight-rope; it was flung round\\nfar-off headlands like a lasso.\\n\\n     And yet, however high they went, the desert still blossomed\\nlike the rose.  The fields were burnished in sun and wind\\nwith the colour of kingfisher and parrot and humming-bird,\\nthe hues of a hundred flowering flowers.  There are no lovelier meadows\\nand woodlands than the English, no nobler crests or chasms than\\nthose of Snowdon and Glencoe.  But Ethel Harrogate had never before\\nseen the southern parks tilted on the splintered northern peaks;\\nthe gorge of Glencoe laden with the fruits of Kent.  There was nothing here\\nof that chill and desolation that in Britain one associates with\\nhigh and wild scenery.  It was rather like a mosaic palace,\\nrent with earthquakes; or like a Dutch tulip garden blown to the stars\\nwith dynamite.\\n\\n     \"It\\'s like Kew Gardens on Beachy Head,\" said Ethel.\\n\\n     \"It is our secret,\" answered he, \"the secret of the volcano;\\nthat is also the secret of the revolution--that a thing can be violent\\nand yet fruitful.\"\\n\\n     \"You are rather violent yourself,\" and she smiled at him.\\n\\n     \"And yet rather fruitless,\" he admitted; \"if I die tonight\\nI die unmarried and a fool.\"\\n\\n     \"It is not my fault if you have come,\" she said after\\na difficult silence.\\n\\n     \"It is never your fault,\" answered Muscari; \"it was not your fault\\nthat Troy fell.\"\\n\\n     As they spoke they came under overwhelming cliffs that spread\\nalmost like wings above a corner of peculiar peril.  Shocked by the\\nbig shadow on the narrow ledge, the horses stirred doubtfully.\\nThe driver leapt to the earth to hold their heads, and they\\nbecame ungovernable.  One horse reared up to his full height--\\nthe titanic and terrifying height of a horse when he becomes a biped.\\nIt was just enough to alter the equilibrium; the whole coach\\nheeled over like a ship and crashed through the fringe of bushes\\nover the cliff.  Muscari threw an arm round Ethel, who clung to him,\\nand shouted aloud.  It was for such moments that he lived.\\n\\n     At the moment when the gorgeous mountain walls went round\\nthe poet\\'s head like a purple windmill a thing happened which was\\nsuperficially even more startling.  The elderly and lethargic banker\\nsprang erect in the coach and leapt over the precipice before\\nthe tilted vehicle could take him there.  In the first flash\\nit looked as wild as suicide; but in the second it was as sensible as\\na safe investment.  The Yorkshireman had evidently more promptitude,\\nas well as more sagacity, than Muscari had given him credit for;\\nfor he landed in a lap of land which might have been specially padded\\nwith turf and clover to receive him.  As it happened, indeed,\\nthe whole company were equally lucky, if less dignified in their\\nform of ejection.  Immediately under this abrupt turn of the road\\nwas a grassy and flowery hollow like a sunken meadow; a sort of\\ngreen velvet pocket in the long, green, trailing garments of the hills.\\nInto this they were all tipped or tumbled with little damage,\\nsave that their smallest baggage and even the contents of their pockets\\nwere scattered in the grass around them.  The wrecked coach still\\nhung above, entangled in the tough hedge, and the horses plunged\\npainfully down the slope.  The first to sit up was the little priest,\\nwho scratched his head with a face of foolish wonder.  Frank Harrogate\\nheard him say to himself: \"Now why on earth have we fallen just here?\"\\n\\n     He blinked at the litter around him, and recovered his own\\nvery clumsy umbrella.  Beyond it lay the broad sombrero fallen from\\nthe head of Muscari, and beside it a sealed business letter which,\\nafter a glance at the address, he returned to the elder Harrogate.\\nOn the other side of him the grass partly hid Miss Ethel\\'s sunshade,\\nand just beyond it lay a curious little glass bottle hardly two inches long.\\nThe priest picked it up; in a quick, unobtrusive manner he uncorked\\nand sniffed it, and his heavy face turned the colour of clay.\\n\\n     \"Heaven deliver us!\" he muttered; \"it can\\'t be hers!\\nHas her sorrow come on her already?\" He slipped it into his own\\nwaistcoat pocket.  \"I think I\\'m justified,\" he said, \"till I know\\na little more.\"\\n\\n     He gazed painfully at the girl, at that moment being raised out of\\nthe flowers by Muscari, who was saying:  \"We have fallen into heaven;\\nit is a sign.  Mortals climb up and they fall down; but it is only\\ngods and goddesses who can fall upwards.\"\\n\\n     And indeed she rose out of the sea of colours so beautiful and\\nhappy a vision that the priest felt his suspicion shaken and shifted.\\n\"After all,\" he thought, \"perhaps the poison isn\\'t hers; perhaps it\\'s\\none of Muscari\\'s melodramatic tricks.\"\\n\\n     Muscari set the lady lightly on her feet, made her an absurdly\\ntheatrical bow, and then, drawing his cutlass, hacked hard at\\nthe taut reins of the horses, so that they scrambled to their feet\\nand stood in the grass trembling.  When he had done so,\\na most remarkable thing occurred.  A very quiet man, very poorly dressed\\nand extremely sunburnt, came out of the bushes and took hold of\\nthe horses\\' heads.  He had a queer-shaped knife, very broad and crooked,\\nbuckled on his belt; there was nothing else remarkable about him,\\nexcept his sudden and silent appearance.  The poet asked him who he was,\\nand he did not answer.\\n\\n     Looking around him at the confused and startled group in the hollow,\\nMuscari then perceived that another tanned and tattered man,\\nwith a short gun under his arm, was looking at them from\\nthe ledge just below, leaning his elbows on the edge of the turf.\\nThen he looked up at the road from which they had fallen and saw,\\nlooking down on them, the muzzles of four other carbines and\\nfour other brown faces with bright but quite motionless eyes.\\n\\n     \"The brigands!\" cried Muscari, with a kind of monstrous gaiety.\\n\"This was a trap.  Ezza, if you will oblige me by shooting the\\ncoachman first, we can cut our way out yet.  There are only six of them.\"\\n\\n     \"The coachman,\" said Ezza, who was standing grimly with his hands\\nin his pockets, \"happens to be a servant of Mr Harrogate\\'s.\"\\n\\n     \"Then shoot him all the more,\" cried the poet impatiently;\\n\"he was bribed to upset his master.  Then put the lady in the middle,\\nand we will break the line up there--with a rush.\"\\n\\n     And, wading in wild grass and flowers, he advanced fearlessly\\non the four carbines; but finding that no one followed except\\nyoung Harrogate, he turned, brandishing his cutlass to wave the others on.\\nHe beheld the courier still standing slightly astride in the centre of\\nthe grassy ring, his hands in his pockets; and his lean, ironical\\nItalian face seemed to grow longer and longer in the evening light.\\n\\n     \"You thought, Muscari, I was the failure among our schoolfellows,\"\\nhe said, \"and you thought you were the success.  But I have succeeded\\nmore than you and fill a bigger place in history.  I have been\\nacting epics while you have been writing them.\"\\n\\n     \"Come on, I tell you!\" thundered Muscari from above.\\n\"Will you stand there talking nonsense about yourself with a woman\\nto save and three strong men to help you?  What do you call yourself?\"\\n\\n     \"I call myself Montano,\" cried the strange courier in a voice\\nequally loud and full.  \"I am the King of Thieves, and I welcome you all\\nto my summer palace.\"\\n\\n     And even as he spoke five more silent men with weapons ready\\ncame out of the bushes, and looked towards him for their orders.\\nOne of them held a large paper in his hand.\\n\\n     \"This pretty little nest where we are all picnicking,\"\\nwent on the courier-brigand, with the same easy yet sinister smile,\\n\"is, together with some caves underneath it, known by the name of\\nthe Paradise of Thieves.  It is my principal stronghold on these hills;\\nfor (as you have doubtless noticed) the eyrie is invisible both from\\nthe road above and from the valley below.  It is something better\\nthan impregnable; it is unnoticeable.  Here I mostly live, and here\\nI shall certainly die, if the gendarmes ever track me here.\\nI am not the kind of criminal that `reserves his defence,\\'\\nbut the better kind that reserves his last bullet.\"\\n\\n     All were staring at him thunderstruck and still, except Father Brown,\\nwho heaved a huge sigh as of relief and fingered the little phial\\nin his pocket.  \"Thank God!\" he muttered; \"that\\'s much more probable.\\nThe poison belongs to this robber-chief, of course.  He carries it\\nso that he may never be captured, like Cato.\"\\n\\n     The King of Thieves was, however, continuing his address with\\nthe same kind of dangerous politeness.  \"It only remains for me,\"\\nhe said, \"to explain to my guests the social conditions upon which\\nI have the pleasure of entertaining them.  I need not expound\\nthe quaint old ritual of ransom, which it is incumbent upon me\\nto keep up; and even this only applies to a part of the company.\\nThe Reverend Father Brown and the celebrated Signor Muscari\\nI shall release tomorrow at dawn and escort to my outposts.\\nPoets and priests, if you will pardon my simplicity of speech,\\nnever have any money.  And so (since it is impossible to get anything\\nout of them), let us, seize the opportunity to show our admiration for\\nclassic literature and our reverence for Holy Church.\"\\n\\n     He paused with an unpleasing smile; and Father Brown\\nblinked repeatedly at him, and seemed suddenly to be listening\\nwith great attention.  The brigand captain took the large paper from\\nthe attendant brigand and, glancing over it, continued:\\n\"My other intentions are clearly set forth in this public document,\\nwhich I will hand round in a moment; and which after that will be\\nposted on a tree by every village in the valley, and every cross-road\\nin the hills.  I will not weary you with the verbalism, since you\\nwill be able to check it; the substance of my proclamation is this:\\nI announce first that I have captured the English millionaire,\\nthe colossus of finance, Mr Samuel Harrogate.  I next announce\\nthat I have found on his person notes and bonds for two thousand pounds,\\nwhich he has given up to me.  Now since it would be really immoral\\nto announce such a thing to a credulous public if it had not occurred,\\nI suggest it should occur without further delay.  I suggest that\\nMr Harrogate senior should now give me the two thousand pounds\\nin his pocket.\"\\n\\n     The banker looked at him under lowering brows, red-faced and sulky,\\nbut seemingly cowed.  That leap from the failing carriage seemed\\nto have used up his last virility.  He had held back in a hang-dog style\\nwhen his son and Muscari had made a bold movement to break out of\\nthe brigand trap.  And now his red and trembling hand went reluctantly\\nto his breast-pocket, and passed a bundle of papers and envelopes\\nto the brigand.\\n\\n     \"Excellent!\" cried that outlaw gaily; \"so far we are all cosy.\\nI resume the points of my proclamation, so soon to be published\\nto all Italy.  The third item is that of ransom.  I am asking\\nfrom the friends of the Harrogate family a ransom of three thousand pounds,\\nwhich I am sure is almost insulting to that family in its moderate estimate\\nof their importance.  Who would not pay triple this sum for another day\\'s\\nassociation with such a domestic circle?  I will not conceal from you\\nthat the document ends with certain legal phrases about\\nthe unpleasant things that may happen if the money is not paid;\\nbut meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you that\\nI am comfortably off here for accommodation, wine and cigars,\\nand bid you for the present a sportsman-like welcome to the luxuries\\nof the Paradise of Thieves.\"\\n\\n     All the time that he had been speaking, the dubious-looking men\\nwith carbines and dirty slouch hats had been gathering silently\\nin such preponderating numbers that even Muscari was compelled\\nto recognize his sally with the sword as hopeless.  He glanced around him;\\nbut the girl had already gone over to soothe and comfort her father,\\nfor her natural affection for his person was as strong or stronger than\\nher somewhat snobbish pride in his success.  Muscari, with the illogicality\\nof a lover, admired this filial devotion, and yet was irritated by it.\\nHe slapped his sword back in the scabbard and went and flung himself\\nsomewhat sulkily on one of the green banks.  The priest sat down\\nwithin a yard or two, and Muscari turned his aquiline nose on him\\nin an instantaneous irritation.\\n\\n     \"Well,\" said the poet tartly, \"do people still think me too romantic?\\nAre there, I wonder, any brigands left in the mountains?\"\\n\\n     \"There may be,\" said Father Brown agnostically.\\n\\n     \"What do you mean?\" asked the other sharply.\\n\\n     \"I mean I am puzzled,\" replied the priest.  \"I am puzzled about\\nEzza or Montano, or whatever his name is.  He seems to me much more\\ninexplicable as a brigand even than he was as a courier.\"\\n\\n     \"But in what way?\" persisted his companion.  \"Santa Maria!\\nI should have thought the brigand was plain enough.\"\\n\\n     \"I find three curious difficulties,\" said the priest in a quiet voice.\\n\"I should like to have your opinion on them.  First of all\\nI must tell you I was lunching in that restaurant at the seaside.\\nAs four of you left the room, you and Miss Harrogate went ahead,\\ntalking and laughing; the banker and the courier came behind,\\nspeaking sparely and rather low.  But I could not help hearing Ezza\\nsay these words--`Well, let her have a little fun; you know the blow\\nmay smash her any minute.\\'  Mr Harrogate answered nothing;\\nso the words must have had some meaning.  On the impulse of the moment\\nI warned her brother that she might be in peril; I said nothing\\nof its nature, for I did not know.  But if it meant this capture\\nin the hills, the thing is nonsense.  Why should the brigand-courier\\nwarn his patron, even by a hint, when it was his whole purpose to lure him\\ninto the mountain-mousetrap?  It could not have meant that.\\nBut if not, what is this disaster, known both to courier and banker,\\nwhich hangs over Miss Harrogate\\'s head?\"\\n\\n     \"Disaster to Miss Harrogate!\" ejaculated the poet, sitting up\\nwith some ferocity.  \"Explain yourself; go on.\"\\n\\n     \"All my riddles, however, revolve round our bandit chief,\"\\nresumed the priest reflectively.  \"And here is the second of them.\\nWhy did he put so prominently in his demand for ransom the fact that\\nhe had taken two thousand pounds from his victim on the spot?\\nIt had no faintest tendency to evoke the ransom.  Quite the other way,\\nin fact.  Harrogate\\'s friends would be far likelier to fear for his fate\\nif they thought the thieves were poor and desperate.  Yet the spoliation\\non the spot was emphasized and even put first in the demand.\\nWhy should Ezza Montano want so specially to tell all Europe that\\nhe had picked the pocket before he levied the blackmail?\"\\n\\n     \"I cannot imagine,\" said Muscari, rubbing up his black hair\\nfor once with an unaffected gesture.  \"You may think you enlighten me,\\nbut you are leading me deeper in the dark.  What may be the third\\nobjection to the King of the Thieves?\"  \"The third objection,\"\\nsaid Father Brown, still in meditation, \"is this bank we are sitting on.\\nWhy does our brigand-courier call this his chief fortress and\\nthe Paradise of Thieves?  It is certainly a soft spot to fall on\\nand a sweet spot to look at.  It is also quite true, as he says,\\nthat it is invisible from valley and peak, and is therefore a hiding-place.\\nBut it is not a fortress.  It never could be a fortress.\\nI think it would be the worst fortress in the world.  For it is actually\\ncommanded from above by the common high-road across the mountains--\\nthe very place where the police would most probably pass.\\nWhy, five shabby short guns held us helpless here about half an hour ago.\\nThe quarter of a company of any kind of soldiers could have blown us\\nover the precipice.  Whatever is the meaning of this odd little nook\\nof grass and flowers, it is not an entrenched position.\\nIt is something else; it has some other strange sort of importance;\\nsome value that I do not understand.  It is more like an accidental theatre\\nor a natural green-room; it is like the scene for some romantic comedy;\\nit is like....\"\\n\\n     As the little priest\\'s words lengthened and lost themselves\\nin a dull and dreamy sincerity, Muscari, whose animal senses were alert\\nand impatient, heard a new noise in the mountains.  Even for him\\nthe sound was as yet very small and faint; but he could have sworn\\nthe evening breeze bore with it something like the pulsation of\\nhorses\\' hoofs and a distant hallooing.\\n\\n     At the same moment, and long before the vibration had touched\\nthe less-experienced English ears, Montano the brigand ran up\\nthe bank above them and stood in the broken hedge, steadying himself\\nagainst a tree and peering down the road.  He was a strange figure\\nas he stood there, for he had assumed a flapped fantastic hat and\\nswinging baldric and cutlass in his capacity of bandit king,\\nbut the bright prosaic tweed of the courier showed through in patches\\nall over him.\\n\\n     The next moment he turned his olive, sneering face and made\\na movement with his hand.  The brigands scattered at the signal,\\nnot in confusion, but in what was evidently a kind of guerrilla discipline.\\nInstead of occupying the road along the ridge, they sprinkled themselves\\nalong the side of it behind the trees and the hedge, as if watching unseen\\nfor an enemy.  The noise beyond grew stronger, beginning to shake\\nthe mountain road, and a voice could be clearly heard calling out orders.\\nThe brigands swayed and huddled, cursing and whispering,\\nand the evening air was full of little metallic noises as they\\ncocked their pistols, or loosened their knives, or trailed their scabbards\\nover the stones.  Then the noises from both quarters seemed to meet\\non the road above; branches broke, horses neighed, men cried out.\\n\\n     \"A rescue!\" cried Muscari, springing to his feet and waving his hat;\\n\"the gendarmes are on them!  Now for freedom and a blow for it!\\nNow to be rebels against robbers!  Come, don\\'t let us leave everything\\nto the police; that is so dreadfully modern.  Fall on the rear\\nof these ruffians.  The gendarmes are rescuing us; come, friends,\\nlet us rescue the gendarmes!\"\\n\\n     And throwing his hat over the trees, he drew his cutlass once more\\nand began to escalade the slope up to the road.  Frank Harrogate\\njumped up and ran across to help him, revolver in hand, but was astounded\\nto hear himself imperatively recalled by the raucous voice of his father,\\nwho seemed to be in great agitation.\\n\\n     \"I won\\'t have it,\" said the banker in a choking voice;\\n\"I command you not to interfere.\"\\n\\n     \"But, father,\" said Frank very warmly, \"an Italian gentleman has\\nled the way.  You wouldn\\'t have it said that the English hung back.\"\\n\\n     \"It is useless,\" said the older man, who was trembling violently,\\n\"it is useless.  We must submit to our lot.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown looked at the banker; then he put his hand instinctively\\nas if on his heart, but really on the little bottle of poison;\\nand a great light came into his face like the light of the revelation\\nof death.\\n\\n     Muscari meanwhile, without waiting for support, had crested the bank\\nup to the road, and struck the brigand king heavily on the shoulder,\\ncausing him to stagger and swing round.  Montano also had\\nhis cutlass unsheathed, and Muscari, without further speech,\\nsent a slash at his head which he was compelled to catch and parry.\\nBut even as the two short blades crossed and clashed the King of Thieves\\ndeliberately dropped his point and laughed.\\n\\n     \"What\\'s the good, old man?\" he said in spirited Italian slang;\\n\"this damned farce will soon be over.\"\\n\\n     \"What do you mean, you shuffler?\" panted the fire-eating poet.\\n\"Is your courage a sham as well as your honesty?\"\\n\\n     \"Everything about me is a sham,\" responded the ex-courier\\nin complete good humour.  \"I am an actor; and if I ever had\\na private character, I have forgotten it.  I am no more a genuine brigand\\nthan I am a genuine courier.  I am only a bundle of masks,\\nand you can\\'t fight a duel with that.\"  And he laughed with boyish pleasure\\nand fell into his old straddling attitude, with his back to the skirmish\\nup the road.\\n\\n     Darkness was deepening under the mountain walls, and it was not easy\\nto discern much of the progress of the struggle, save that tall men\\nwere pushing their horses\\' muzzles through a clinging crowd of brigands,\\nwho seemed more inclined to harass and hustle the invaders\\nthan to kill them.  It was more like a town crowd preventing\\nthe passage of the police than anything the poet had ever pictured\\nas the last stand of doomed and outlawed men of blood.  Just as he was\\nrolling his eyes in bewilderment he felt a touch on his elbow,\\nand found the odd little priest standing there like a small Noah\\nwith a large hat, and requesting the favour of a word or two.\\n\\n     \"Signor Muscari,\" said the cleric, \"in this queer crisis\\npersonalities may be pardoned.  I may tell you without offence\\nof a way in which you will do more good than by helping the gendarmes,\\nwho are bound to break through in any case.  You will permit me\\nthe impertinent intimacy, but do you care about that girl?\\nCare enough to marry her and make her a good husband, I mean?\"\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" said the poet quite simply.\\n\\n     \"Does she care about you?\"\\n\\n     \"I think so,\" was the equally grave reply.\\n\\n     \"Then go over there and offer yourself,\" said the priest:\\n\"offer her everything you can; offer her heaven and earth\\nif you\\'ve got them.  The time is short.\"\\n\\n     \"Why?\" asked the astonished man of letters.\\n\\n     \"Because,\" said Father Brown, \"her Doom is coming up the road.\"\\n\\n     \"Nothing is coming up the road,\" argued Muscari, \"except the rescue.\"\\n\\n     \"Well, you go over there,\" said his adviser, \"and be ready\\nto rescue her from the rescue.\"\\n\\n     Almost as he spoke the hedges were broken all along the ridge\\nby a rush of the escaping brigands.  They dived into bushes\\nand thick grass like defeated men pursued; and the great cocked hats\\nof the mounted gendarmerie were seen passing along above the broken hedge.\\nAnother order was given; there was a noise of dismounting,\\nand a tall officer with cocked hat, a grey imperial, and a paper in his hand\\nappeared in the gap that was the gate of the Paradise of Thieves.\\nThere was a momentary silence, broken in an extraordinary way by the banker,\\nwho cried out in a hoarse and strangled voice: \"Robbed!  I\\'ve been robbed!\"\\n\\n     \"Why, that was hours ago,\" cried his son in astonishment:\\n\"when you were robbed of two thousand pounds.\"\\n\\n     \"Not of two thousand pounds,\" said the financier, with an abrupt\\nand terrible composure, \"only of a small bottle.\"\\n\\n     The policeman with the grey imperial was striding across\\nthe green hollow.  Encountering the King of the Thieves in his path,\\nhe clapped him on the shoulder with something between a caress\\nand a buffet and gave him a push that sent him staggering away.\\n\"You\\'ll get into trouble, too,\" he said, \"if you play these tricks.\"\\n\\n     Again to Muscari\\'s artistic eye it seemed scarcely like\\nthe capture of a great outlaw at bay.  Passing on, the policeman halted\\nbefore the Harrogate group and said:  \"Samuel Harrogate, I arrest you\\nin the name of the law for embezzlement of the funds of the Hull and\\nHuddersfield Bank.\"\\n\\n     The great banker nodded with an odd air of business assent,\\nseemed to reflect a moment, and before they could interpose took\\na half turn and a step that brought him to the edge of the outer\\nmountain wall.  Then, flinging up his hands, he leapt exactly as he leapt\\nout of the coach.  But this time he did not fall into a little meadow\\njust beneath; he fell a thousand feet below, to become a wreck of bones\\nin the valley.\\n\\n     The anger of the Italian policeman, which he expressed volubly\\nto Father Brown, was largely mixed with admiration.  \"It was like him\\nto escape us at last,\" he said.  \"He was a great brigand if you like.\\nThis last trick of his I believe to be absolutely unprecedented.\\nHe fled with the company\\'s money to Italy, and actually got himself\\ncaptured by sham brigands in his own pay, so as to explain both the\\ndisappearance of the money and the disappearance of himself.\\nThat demand for ransom was really taken seriously by most of the police.\\nBut for years he\\'s been doing things as good as that, quite as good\\nas that.  He will be a serious loss to his family.\"\\n\\n     Muscari was leading away the unhappy daughter, who held hard to him,\\nas she did for many a year after.  But even in that tragic wreck\\nhe could not help having a smile and a hand of half-mocking friendship\\nfor the indefensible Ezza Montano.  \"And where are you going next?\"\\nhe asked him over his shoulder.\\n\\n     \"Birmingham,\" answered the actor, puffing a cigarette.\\n\"Didn\\'t I tell you I was a Futurist?  I really do believe in those things\\nif I believe in anything.  Change, bustle and new things every morning.\\nI am going to Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Hull, Huddersfield,\\nGlasgow, Chicago--in short, to enlightened, energetic, civilized society!\"\\n\\n     \"In short,\" said Muscari, \"to the real Paradise of Thieves.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. The Duel of Dr Hirsch\\n\\n\\nM. MAURICE BRUN and M. Armand Armagnac were crossing the sunlit\\nChamps Elysee with a kind of vivacious respectability.\\nThey were both short, brisk and bold.  They both had black beards\\nthat did not seem to belong to their faces, after the strange French fashion\\nwhich makes real hair look like artificial.  M. Brun had\\na dark wedge of beard apparently affixed under his lower lip.\\nM. Armagnac, by way of a change, had two beards; one sticking out\\nfrom each corner of his emphatic chin.  They were both young.\\nThey were both atheists, with a depressing fixity of outlook\\nbut great mobility of exposition.  They were both pupils of\\nthe great Dr Hirsch, scientist, publicist and moralist.\\n\\n     M. Brun had become prominent by his proposal that the common\\nexpression \"Adieu\" should be obliterated from all the French classics,\\nand a slight fine imposed for its use in private life.  \"Then,\" he said,\\n\"the very name of your imagined God will have echoed for the last time\\nin the ear of man.\"  M. Armagnac specialized rather in a resistance\\nto militarism, and wished the chorus of the Marseillaise altered from\\n\"Aux armes, citoyens\" to \"Aux greves, citoyens\".  But his antimilitarism\\nwas of a peculiar and Gallic sort.  An eminent and very wealthy\\nEnglish Quaker, who had come to see him to arrange for the disarmament\\nof the whole planet, was rather distressed by Armagnac\\'s proposal\\nthat (by way of beginning) the soldiers should shoot their officers.\\n\\n     And indeed it was in this regard that the two men differed most\\nfrom their leader and father in philosophy.  Dr Hirsch,\\nthough born in France and covered with the most triumphant favours\\nof French education, was temperamentally of another type--mild, dreamy,\\nhumane; and, despite his sceptical system, not devoid of transcendentalism.\\nHe was, in short, more like a German than a Frenchman; and much as they\\nadmired him, something in the subconsciousness of these Gauls was\\nirritated at his pleading for peace in so peaceful a manner.\\nTo their party throughout Europe, however, Paul Hirsch was\\na saint of science.  His large and daring cosmic theories\\nadvertised his austere life and innocent, if somewhat frigid, morality;\\nhe held something of the position of Darwin doubled with the position\\nof Tolstoy.  But he was neither an anarchist nor an antipatriot;\\nhis views on disarmament were moderate and evolutionary--\\nthe Republican Government put considerable confidence in him\\nas to various chemical improvements.  He had lately even discovered\\na noiseless explosive, the secret of which the Government was\\ncarefully guarding.\\n\\n     His house stood in a handsome street near the Elysee--\\na street which in that strong summer seemed almost as full of foliage\\nas the park itself; a row of chestnuts shattered the sunshine,\\ninterrupted only in one place where a large cafe ran out into the street.\\nAlmost opposite to this were the white and green blinds of\\nthe great scientist\\'s house, an iron balcony, also painted green,\\nrunning along in front of the first-floor windows.  Beneath this was\\nthe entrance into a kind of court, gay with shrubs and tiles,\\ninto which the two Frenchmen passed in animated talk.\\n\\n     The door was opened to them by the doctor\\'s old servant, Simon,\\nwho might very well have passed for a doctor himself, having a strict\\nsuit of black, spectacles, grey hair, and a confidential manner.\\nIn fact, he was a far more presentable man of science than his master,\\nDr Hirsch, who was a forked radish of a fellow, with just enough\\nbulb of a head to make his body insignificant.  With all the gravity\\nof a great physician handling a prescription, Simon handed a letter\\nto M. Armagnac.  That gentleman ripped it up with a racial impatience,\\nand rapidly read the following:\\n\\n     I cannot come down to speak to you.  There is a man in this house\\nwhom I refuse to meet.  He is a Chauvinist officer, Dubosc.\\nHe is sitting on the stairs.  He has been kicking the furniture about\\nin all the other rooms; I have locked myself in my study,\\nopposite that cafe.  If you love me, go over to the cafe and wait\\nat one of the tables outside.  I will try to send him over to you.\\nI want you to answer him and deal with him.  I cannot meet him myself.\\nI cannot: I will not.\\n\\n     There is going to be another Dreyfus case.\\n\\n                                             P. HIRSCH\\n\\n\\n\\n     M. Armagnac looked at M. Brun.  M. Brun borrowed the letter,\\nread it, and looked at M. Armagnac.  Then both betook themselves briskly\\nto one of the little tables under the chestnuts opposite,\\nwhere they procured two tall glasses of horrible green absinthe,\\nwhich they could drink apparently in any weather and at any time.\\nOtherwise the cafe seemed empty, except for one soldier drinking coffee\\nat one table, and at another a large man drinking a small syrup and\\na priest drinking nothing.\\n\\n     Maurice Brun cleared his throat and said:  \"Of course we must help\\nthe master in every way, but--\"\\n\\n     There was an abrupt silence, and Armagnac said:  \"He may have\\nexcellent reasons for not meeting the man himself, but--\"\\n\\n     Before either could complete a sentence, it was evident that\\nthe invader had been expelled from the house opposite.  The shrubs under\\nthe archway swayed and burst apart, as that unwelcome guest was\\nshot out of them like a cannon-ball.\\n\\n     He was a sturdy figure in a small and tilted Tyrolean felt hat,\\na figure that had indeed something generally Tyrolean about it.\\nThe man\\'s shoulders were big and broad, but his legs were neat and active\\nin knee-breeches and knitted stockings.  His face was brown like a nut;\\nhe had very bright and restless brown eyes; his dark hair was brushed back\\nstiffly in front and cropped close behind, outlining a square and\\npowerful skull; and he had a huge black moustache like the horns of a bison.\\nSuch a substantial head is generally based on a bull neck; but this was\\nhidden by a big coloured scarf, swathed round up the man\\'s ears\\nand falling in front inside his jacket like a sort of fancy waistcoat.\\nIt was a scarf of strong dead colours, dark red and old gold and purple,\\nprobably of Oriental fabrication.  Altogether the man had something\\na shade barbaric about him; more like a Hungarian squire than\\nan ordinary French officer.  His French, however, was obviously\\nthat of a native; and his French patriotism was so impulsive\\nas to be slightly absurd.  His first act when he burst out of the archway\\nwas to call in a clarion voice down the street:  \"Are there any\\nFrenchmen here?\" as if he were calling for Christians in Mecca.\\n\\n     Armagnac and Brun instantly stood up; but they were too late.\\nMen were already running from the street corners; there was a small\\nbut ever-clustering crowd.  With the prompt French instinct for\\nthe politics of the street, the man with the black moustache had already\\nrun across to a corner of the cafe, sprung on one of the tables,\\nand seizing a branch of chestnut to steady himself, shouted\\nas Camille Desmoulins once shouted when he scattered the oak-leaves\\namong the populace.\\n\\n     \"Frenchmen!\" he volleyed; \"I cannot speak!  God help me, that is why\\nI am speaking!  The fellows in their filthy parliaments who learn\\nto speak also learn to be silent--silent as that spy cowering\\nin the house opposite!  Silent as he is when I beat on his bedroom door!\\nSilent as he is now, though he hears my voice across this street\\nand shakes where he sits!  Oh, they can be silent eloquently--\\nthe politicians!  But the time has come when we that cannot speak\\nmust speak.  You are betrayed to the Prussians.  Betrayed at this moment.\\nBetrayed by that man.  I am Jules Dubosc, Colonel of Artillery, Belfort.\\nWe caught a German spy in the Vosges yesterday, and a paper was found\\non him--a paper I hold in my hand.  Oh, they tried to hush it up;\\nbut I took it direct to the man who wrote it--the man in that house!\\nIt is in his hand.  It is signed with his initials.  It is a direction\\nfor finding the secret of this new Noiseless Powder.  Hirsch invented it;\\nHirsch wrote this note about it.  This note is in German, and was found\\nin a German\\'s pocket.  `Tell the man the formula for powder is in\\ngrey envelope in first drawer to the left of Secretary\\'s desk,\\nWar Office, in red ink.  He must be careful.  P.H.\\'\"\\n\\n     He rattled short sentences like a quick-firing gun, but he was plainly\\nthe sort of man who is either mad or right.  The mass of the crowd\\nwas Nationalist, and already in threatening uproar; and a minority\\nof equally angry Intellectuals, led by Armagnac and Brun, only made\\nthe majority more militant.\\n\\n     \"If this is a military secret,\" shouted Brun, \"why do you yell\\nabout it in the street?\"\\n\\n     \"I will tell you why I do!\" roared Dubosc above the roaring crowd.\\n\"I went to this man in straight and civil style.  If he had any explanation\\nit could have been given in complete confidence.  He refuses to explain.\\nHe refers me to two strangers in a cafe as to two flunkeys.\\nHe has thrown me out of the house, but I am going back into it,\\nwith the people of Paris behind me!\"\\n\\n     A shout seemed to shake the very facade of mansions and\\ntwo stones flew, one breaking a window above the balcony.\\nThe indignant Colonel plunged once more under the archway and was heard\\ncrying and thundering inside.  Every instant the human sea grew wider\\nand wider; it surged up against the rails and steps of the traitor\\'s house;\\nit was already certain that the place would be burst into like\\nthe Bastille, when the broken french window opened and Dr Hirsch came out\\non the balcony.  For an instant the fury half turned to laughter;\\nfor he was an absurd figure in such a scene.  His long bare neck and\\nsloping shoulders were the shape of a champagne bottle, but that was\\nthe only festive thing about him.  His coat hung on him as on a peg;\\nhe wore his carrot-coloured hair long and weedy; his cheeks and chin\\nwere fully fringed with one of those irritating beards that begin\\nfar from the mouth.  He was very pale, and he wore blue spectacles.\\n\\n     Livid as he was, he spoke with a sort of prim decision,\\nso that the mob fell silent in the middle of his third sentence.\\n\\n     \"...only two things to say to you now.  The first is to my foes,\\nthe second to my friends.  To my foes I say:  It is true I will not\\nmeet M. Dubosc, though he is storming outside this very room.\\nIt is true I have asked two other men to confront him for me.\\nAnd I will tell you why!  Because I will not and must not see him--\\nbecause it would be against all rules of dignity and honour to see him.\\nBefore I am triumphantly cleared before a court, there is\\nanother arbitration this gentleman owes me as a gentleman,\\nand in referring him to my seconds I am strictly--\"\\n\\n     Armagnac and Brun were waving their hats wildly, and even\\nthe Doctor\\'s enemies roared applause at this unexpected defiance.\\nOnce more a few sentences were inaudible, but they could hear him say:\\n\"To my friends--I myself should always prefer weapons purely intellectual,\\nand to these an evolved humanity will certainly confine itself.\\nBut our own most precious truth is the fundamental force of matter\\nand heredity.  My books are successful; my theories are unrefuted;\\nbut I suffer in politics from a prejudice almost physical in the French.\\nI cannot speak like Clemenceau and Deroulede, for their words are like\\nechoes of their pistols.  The French ask for a duellist as the English\\nask for a sportsman.  Well, I give my proofs:  I will pay\\nthis barbaric bribe, and then go back to reason for the rest of my life.\"\\n\\n     Two men were instantly found in the crowd itself to offer\\ntheir services to Colonel Dubosc, who came out presently, satisfied.\\nOne was the common soldier with the coffee, who said simply:\\n\"I will act for you, sir.  I am the Duc de Valognes.\"  The other was\\nthe big man, whom his friend the priest sought at first to dissuade;\\nand then walked away alone.\\n\\n     In the early evening a light dinner was spread at the back of\\nthe Cafe Charlemagne.  Though unroofed by any glass or gilt plaster,\\nthe guests were nearly all under a delicate and irregular roof of leaves;\\nfor the ornamental trees stood so thick around and among the tables\\nas to give something of the dimness and the dazzle of a small orchard.\\nAt one of the central tables a very stumpy little priest sat\\nin complete solitude, and applied himself to a pile of whitebait\\nwith the gravest sort of enjoyment.  His daily living being very plain,\\nhe had a peculiar taste for sudden and isolated luxuries; he was\\nan abstemious epicure.  He did not lift his eyes from his plate,\\nround which red pepper, lemons, brown bread and butter, etc.,\\nwere rigidly ranked, until a tall shadow fell across the table,\\nand his friend Flambeau sat down opposite.  Flambeau was gloomy.\\n\\n     \"I\\'m afraid I must chuck this business,\" said he heavily.\\n\"I\\'m all on the side of the French soldiers like Dubosc,\\nand I\\'m all against the French atheists like Hirsch; but it seems to me\\nin this case we\\'ve made a mistake.  The Duke and I thought it as well\\nto investigate the charge, and I must say I\\'m glad we did.\"\\n\\n     \"Is the paper a forgery, then?\" asked the priest\\n\\n     \"That\\'s just the odd thing,\" replied Flambeau.  \"It\\'s exactly like\\nHirsch\\'s writing, and nobody can point out any mistake in it.\\nBut it wasn\\'t written by Hirsch.  If he\\'s a French patriot\\nhe didn\\'t write it, because it gives information to Germany.\\nAnd if he\\'s a German spy he didn\\'t write it, well--because it doesn\\'t\\ngive information to Germany.\"\\n\\n     \"You mean the information is wrong?\" asked Father Brown.\\n\\n     \"Wrong,\" replied the other, \"and wrong exactly where Dr Hirsch\\nwould have been right--about the hiding-place of his own secret formula\\nin his own official department.  By favour of Hirsch and the authorities,\\nthe Duke and I have actually been allowed to inspect the secret drawer\\nat the War Office where the Hirsch formula is kept.  We are the only people\\nwho have ever known it, except the inventor himself and the Minister\\nfor War; but the Minister permitted it to save Hirsch from fighting.\\nAfter that we really can\\'t support Dubosc if his revelation\\nis a mare\\'s nest.\"\\n\\n     \"And it is?\" asked Father Brown.\\n\\n     \"It is,\" said his friend gloomily.  \"It is a clumsy forgery\\nby somebody who knew nothing of the real hiding-place.  It says the paper\\nis in the cupboard on the right of the Secretary\\'s desk.  As a fact\\nthe cupboard with the secret drawer is some way to the left of the desk.\\nIt says the grey envelope contains a long document written in red ink.\\nIt isn\\'t written in red ink, but in ordinary black ink.\\nIt\\'s manifestly absurd to say that Hirsch can have made a mistake\\nabout a paper that nobody knew of but himself; or can have tried\\nto help a foreign thief by telling him to fumble in the wrong drawer.\\nI think we must chuck it up and apologize to old Carrots.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown seemed to cogitate; he lifted a little whitebait\\non his fork.  \"You are sure the grey envelope was in the left cupboard?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\\n     \"Positive,\" replied Flambeau.  \"The grey envelope--\\nit was a white envelope really--was--\"\\n\\n     Father Brown put down the small silver fish and the fork and\\nstared across at his companion.  \"What?\" he asked, in an altered voice.\\n\\n     \"Well, what?\" repeated Flambeau, eating heartily.\\n\\n     \"It was not grey,\" said the priest.  \"Flambeau, you frighten me.\"\\n\\n     \"What the deuce are you frightened of?\"\\n\\n     \"I\\'m frightened of a white envelope,\" said the other seriously,\\n\"If it had only just been grey!  Hang it all, it might as well\\nhave been grey.  But if it was white, the whole business is black.\\nThe Doctor has been dabbling in some of the old brimstone after all.\"\\n\\n     \"But I tell you he couldn\\'t have written such a note!\"\\ncried Flambeau.  \"The note is utterly wrong about the facts.\\nAnd innocent or guilty, Dr Hirsch knew all about the facts.\"\\n\\n     \"The man who wrote that note knew all about the facts,\"\\nsaid his clerical companion soberly.  \"He could never have\\ngot \\'em so wrong without knowing about \\'em.  You have to know\\nan awful lot to be wrong on every subject--like the devil.\"\\n\\n     \"Do you mean--?\"\\n\\n     \"I mean a man telling lies on chance would have told some of the truth,\"\\nsaid his friend firmly.  \"Suppose someone sent you to find a house\\nwith a green door and a blue blind, with a front garden but no back garden,\\nwith a dog but no cat, and where they drank coffee but not tea.\\nYou would say if you found no such house that it was all made up.\\nBut I say no.  I say if you found a house where the door was blue and\\nthe blind green, where there was a back garden and no front garden,\\nwhere cats were common and dogs instantly shot, where tea was drunk\\nin quarts and coffee forbidden--then you would know you had\\nfound the house.  The man must have known that particular house\\nto be so accurately inaccurate.\"\\n\\n     \"But what could it mean?\" demanded the diner opposite.\\n\\n     \"I can\\'t conceive,\" said Brown; \"I don\\'t understand this Hirsch\\naffair at all.  As long as it was only the left drawer instead of\\nthe right, and red ink instead of black, I thought it must be the\\nchance blunders of a forger, as you say.  But three is a mystical number;\\nit finishes things.  It finishes this.  That the direction about\\nthe drawer, the colour of ink, the colour of envelope, should none of\\nthem be right by accident, that can\\'t be a coincidence.  It wasn\\'t.\"\\n\\n     \"What was it, then?  Treason?\" asked Flambeau, resuming his dinner.\\n\\n     \"I don\\'t know that either,\" answered Brown, with a face\\nof blank bewilderment.  \"The only thing I can think of....\\nWell, I never understood that Dreyfus case.  I can always grasp\\nmoral evidence easier than the other sorts.  I go by a man\\'s eyes and voice,\\ndon\\'t you know, and whether his family seems happy, and by what\\nsubjects he chooses--and avoids.  Well, I was puzzled in the Dreyfus case.\\nNot by the horrible things imputed both ways; I know (though it\\'s not\\nmodern to say so) that human nature in the highest places is still capable\\nof being Cenci or Borgia.  No--, what puzzled me was the sincerity\\nof both parties.  I don\\'t mean the political parties; the rank and file\\nare always roughly honest, and often duped.  I mean the persons\\nof the play.  I mean the conspirators, if they were conspirators.\\nI mean the traitor, if he was a traitor.  I mean the men who must have\\nknown the truth.  Now Dreyfus went on like a man who knew he was\\na wronged man.  And yet the French statesmen and soldiers went on\\nas if they knew he wasn\\'t a wronged man but simply a wrong \\'un.\\nI don\\'t mean they behaved well; I mean they behaved as if they were sure.\\nI can\\'t describe these things; I know what I mean.\"\\n\\n     \"I wish I did,\" said his friend.  \"And what has it to do\\nwith old Hirsch?\"\\n\\n     \"Suppose a person in a position of trust,\" went on the priest,\\n\"began to give the enemy information because it was false information.\\nSuppose he even thought he was saving his country by misleading the foreigner.\\nSuppose this brought him into spy circles, and little loans were made to him,\\nand little ties tied on to him.  Suppose he kept up his contradictory\\nposition in a confused way by never telling the foreign spies the truth,\\nbut letting it more and more be guessed.  The better part of him\\n(what was left of it) would still say:  `I have not helped the enemy;\\nI said it was the left drawer.\\'  The meaner part of him would already\\nbe saying:  `But they may have the sense to see that means the right.\\'\\nI think it is psychologically possible--in an enlightened age, you know.\"\\n\\n     \"It may be psychologically possible,\" answered Flambeau,\\n\"and it certainly would explain Dreyfus being certain he was wronged\\nand his judges being sure he was guilty.  But it won\\'t wash historically,\\nbecause Dreyfus\\'s document (if it was his document) was literally correct.\"\\n\\n     \"I wasn\\'t thinking of Dreyfus,\" said Father Brown.\\n\\n     Silence had sunk around them with the emptying of the tables;\\nit was already late, though the sunlight still clung to everything,\\nas if accidentally entangled in the trees.  In the stillness Flambeau\\nshifted his seat sharply--making an isolated and echoing noise--\\nand threw his elbow over the angle of it.  \"Well,\" he said, rather harshly,\\n\"if Hirsch is not better than a timid treason-monger...\"\\n\\n     \"You mustn\\'t be too hard on them,\" said Father Brown gently.\\n\"It\\'s not entirely their fault; but they have no instincts.\\nI mean those things that make a woman refuse to dance with a man\\nor a man to touch an investment.  They\\'ve been taught that\\nit\\'s all a matter of degree.\"\\n\\n     \"Anyhow,\" cried Flambeau impatiently, \"he\\'s not a patch\\non my principal; and I shall go through with it.  Old Dubosc may be\\na bit mad, but he\\'s a sort of patriot after all.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown continued to consume whitebait.\\n\\n     Something in the stolid way he did so caused Flambeau\\'s\\nfierce black eyes to ramble over his companion afresh.  \"What\\'s the matter\\nwith you?\" Flambeau demanded.  \"Dubosc\\'s all right in that way.\\nYou don\\'t doubt him?\"\\n\\n     \"My friend,\" said the small priest, laying down his knife and fork\\nin a kind of cold despair, \"I doubt everything.  Everything, I mean,\\nthat has happened today.  I doubt the whole story, though it has been\\nacted before my face.  I doubt every sight that my eyes have seen\\nsince morning.  There is something in this business quite different\\nfrom the ordinary police mystery where one man is more or less lying\\nand the other man more or less telling the truth.  Here both men....\\nWell!  I\\'ve told you the only theory I can think of that could\\nsatisfy anybody.  It doesn\\'t satisfy me.\"\\n\\n     \"Nor me either,\" replied Flambeau frowning, while the other\\nwent on eating fish with an air of entire resignation.  \"If all you\\ncan suggest is that notion of a message conveyed by contraries,\\nI call it uncommonly clever, but...well, what would you call it?\"\\n\\n     \"I should call it thin,\" said the priest promptly.\\n\"I should call it uncommonly thin.  But that\\'s the queer thing\\nabout the whole business.  The lie is like a schoolboy\\'s.\\nThere are only three versions, Dubosc\\'s and Hirsch\\'s and that fancy of mine.\\nEither that note was written by a French officer to ruin a French official;\\nor it was written by the French official to help German officers;\\nor it was written by the French official to mislead German officers.\\nVery well.  You\\'d expect a secret paper passing between such people,\\nofficials or officers, to look quite different from that.\\nYou\\'d expect, probably a cipher, certainly abbreviations;\\nmost certainly scientific and strictly professional terms.\\nBut this thing\\'s elaborately simple, like a penny dreadful:\\n`In the purple grotto you will find the golden casket.\\' It looks as if...\\nas if it were meant to be seen through at once.\"\\n\\n     Almost before they could take it in a short figure in French uniform\\nhad walked up to their table like the wind, and sat down\\nwith a sort of thump.\\n\\n     \"I have extraordinary news,\" said the Duc de Valognes.\\n\"I have just come from this Colonel of ours.  He is packing up\\nto leave the country, and he asks us to make his excuses sur le terrain.\"\\n\\n     \"What?\" cried Flambeau, with an incredulity quite frightful--\\n\"apologize?\"\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" said the Duke gruffly; \"then and there--before everybody--\\nwhen the swords are drawn.  And you and I have to do it while\\nhe is leaving the country.\"\\n\\n     \"But what can this mean?\" cried Flambeau.  \"He can\\'t be afraid of\\nthat little Hirsch!  Confound it!\" he cried, in a kind of rational rage;\\n\"nobody could be afraid of Hirsch!\"\\n\\n     \"I believe it\\'s some plot!\" snapped Valognes--\"some plot of\\nthe Jews and Freemasons.  It\\'s meant to work up glory for Hirsch...\"\\n\\n     The face of Father Brown was commonplace, but curiously contented;\\nit could shine with ignorance as well as with knowledge.\\nBut there was always one flash when the foolish mask fell,\\nand the wise mask fitted itself in its place; and Flambeau,\\nwho knew his friend, knew that his friend had suddenly understood.\\nBrown said nothing, but finished his plate of fish.\\n\\n     \"Where did you last see our precious Colonel?\" asked Flambeau,\\nirritably.\\n\\n     \"He\\'s round at the Hotel Saint Louis by the Elysee,\\nwhere we drove with him.  He\\'s packing up, I tell you.\"\\n\\n     \"Will he be there still, do you think?\" asked Flambeau,\\nfrowning at the table.\\n\\n     \"I don\\'t think he can get away yet,\" replied the Duke;\\n\"he\\'s packing to go a long journey...\"\\n\\n     \"No,\" said Father Brown, quite simply, but suddenly standing up,\\n\"for a very short journey.  For one of the shortest, in fact.\\nBut we may still be in time to catch him if we go there in a motor-cab.\"\\n\\n     Nothing more could be got out of him until the cab swept\\nround the corner by the Hotel Saint Louis, where they got out,\\nand he led the party up a side lane already in deep shadow with\\nthe growing dusk.  Once, when the Duke impatiently asked whether\\nHirsch was guilty of treason or not, he answered rather absently:\\n\"No; only of ambition--like Caesar.\" Then he somewhat inconsequently added:\\n\"He lives a very lonely life; he has had to do everything for himself.\"\\n\\n     \"Well, if he\\'s ambitious, he ought to be satisfied now,\"\\nsaid Flambeau rather bitterly.  \"All Paris will cheer him\\nnow our cursed Colonel has turned tail.\"\\n\\n     \"Don\\'t talk so loud,\" said Father Brown, lowering his voice,\\n\"your cursed Colonel is just in front.\"\\n\\n     The other two started and shrank farther back into the shadow\\nof the wall, for the sturdy figure of their runaway principal\\ncould indeed be seen shuffling along in the twilight in front,\\na bag in each hand.  He looked much the same as when they first saw him,\\nexcept that he had changed his picturesque mountaineering knickers\\nfor a conventional pair of trousers.  It was clear he was already\\nescaping from the hotel.\\n\\n     The lane down which they followed him was one of those that\\nseem to be at the back of things, and look like the wrong side\\nof the stage scenery.  A colourless, continuous wall ran down\\none flank of it, interrupted at intervals by dull-hued and\\ndirt-stained doors, all shut fast and featureless save for\\nthe chalk scribbles of some passing gamin.  The tops of trees,\\nmostly rather depressing evergreens, showed at intervals over\\nthe top of the wall, and beyond them in the grey and purple gloaming\\ncould be seen the back of some long terrace of tall Parisian houses,\\nreally comparatively close, but somehow looking as inaccessible\\nas a range of marble mountains.  On the other side of the lane ran\\nthe high gilt railings of a gloomy park.\\n\\n     Flambeau was looking round him in rather a weird way.\\n\"Do you know,\" he said, \"there is something about this place that--\"\\n\\n     \"Hullo!\" called out the Duke sharply; \"that fellow\\'s disappeared.\\nVanished, like a blasted fairy!\"\\n\\n     \"He has a key,\" explained their clerical friend.  \"He\\'s only gone\\ninto one of these garden doors,\" and as he spoke they heard one of\\nthe dull wooden doors close again with a click in front of them.\\n\\n     Flambeau strode up to the door thus shut almost in his face,\\nand stood in front of it for a moment, biting his black moustache\\nin a fury of curiosity.  Then he threw up his long arms and\\nswung himself aloft like a monkey and stood on the top of the wall,\\nhis enormous figure dark against the purple sky, like the dark tree-tops.\\n\\n     The Duke looked at the priest.  \"Dubosc\\'s escape is\\nmore elaborate than we thought,\" he said; \"but I suppose he is\\nescaping from France.\"\\n\\n     \"He is escaping from everywhere,\" answered Father Brown.\\n\\n     Valognes\\'s eyes brightened, but his voice sank.  \"Do you mean\\nsuicide?\" he asked.\\n\\n     \"You will not find his body,\" replied the other.\\n\\n     A kind of cry came from Flambeau on the wall above.\\n\"My God,\" he exclaimed in French, \"I know what this place is now!\\nWhy, it\\'s the back of the street where old Hirsch lives.  I thought\\nI could recognize the back of a house as well as the back of a man.\"\\n\\n     \"And Dubosc\\'s gone in there!\" cried the Duke, smiting his hip.\\n\"Why, they\\'ll meet after all!\" And with sudden Gallic vivacity\\nhe hopped up on the wall beside Flambeau and sat there positively\\nkicking his legs with excitement.  The priest alone remained below,\\nleaning against the wall, with his back to the whole theatre of events,\\nand looking wistfully across to the park palings and the twinkling,\\ntwilit trees.\\n\\n     The Duke, however stimulated, had the instincts of an aristocrat,\\nand desired rather to stare at the house than to spy on it;\\nbut Flambeau, who had the instincts of a burglar (and a detective),\\nhad already swung himself from the wall into the fork of a straggling tree\\nfrom which he could crawl quite close to the only illuminated window\\nin the back of the high dark house.  A red blind had been pulled down\\nover the light, but pulled crookedly, so that it gaped on one side,\\nand by risking his neck along a branch that looked as treacherous\\nas a twig, Flambeau could just see Colonel Dubosc walking about\\nin a brilliantly-lighted and luxurious bedroom.  But close as Flambeau was\\nto the house, he heard the words of his colleagues by the wall,\\nand repeated them in a low voice.\\n\\n     \"Yes, they will meet now after all!\"\\n\\n     \"They will never meet,\" said Father Brown.  \"Hirsch was right\\nwhen he said that in such an affair the principals must not meet.\\nHave you read a queer psychological story by Henry James,\\nof two persons who so perpetually missed meeting each other by accident\\nthat they began to feel quite frightened of each other, and to think\\nit was fate?  This is something of the kind, but more curious.\"\\n\\n     \"There are people in Paris who will cure them of such morbid fancies,\"\\nsaid Valognes vindictively.  \"They will jolly well have to meet\\nif we capture them and force them to fight.\"\\n\\n     \"They will not meet on the Day of Judgement,\" said the priest.\\n\"If God Almighty held the truncheon of the lists, if St Michael\\nblew the trumpet for the swords to cross--even then, if one of them\\nstood ready, the other would not come.\"\\n\\n     \"Oh, what does all this mysticism mean?\" cried the Duc de Valognes,\\nimpatiently; \"why on earth shouldn\\'t they meet like other people?\"\\n\\n     \"They are the opposite of each other,\" said Father Brown,\\nwith a queer kind of smile.  \"They contradict each other.\\nThey cancel out, so to speak.\"\\n\\n     He continued to gaze at the darkening trees opposite, but Valognes\\nturned his head sharply at a suppressed exclamation from Flambeau.\\nThat investigator, peering into the lighted room, had just seen\\nthe Colonel, after a pace or two, proceed to take his coat off.\\nFlambeau\\'s first thought was that this really looked like a fight;\\nbut he soon dropped the thought for another.  The solidity and\\nsquareness of Dubosc\\'s chest and shoulders was all a powerful piece\\nof padding and came off with his coat.  In his shirt and trousers\\nhe was a comparatively slim gentleman, who walked across the bedroom to\\nthe bathroom with no more pugnacious purpose than that of washing himself.\\nHe bent over a basin, dried his dripping hands and face on a towel,\\nand turned again so that the strong light fell on his face.\\nHis brown complexion had gone, his big black moustache had gone;\\nhe--was clean-shaven and very pate.  Nothing remained of the Colonel\\nbut his bright, hawk-like, brown eyes.  Under the wall Father Brown\\nwas going on in heavy meditation, as if to himself.\\n\\n     \"It is all just like what I was saying to Flambeau.\\nThese opposites won\\'t do.  They don\\'t work.  They don\\'t fight.\\nIf it\\'s white instead of black, and solid instead of liquid,\\nand so on all along the line--then there\\'s something wrong, Monsieur,\\nthere\\'s something wrong.  One of these men is fair and the other dark,\\none stout and the other slim, one strong and the other weak.\\nOne has a moustache and no beard, so you can\\'t see his mouth;\\nthe other has a beard and no moustache, so you can\\'t see his chin.\\nOne has hair cropped to his skull, but a scarf to hide his neck;\\nthe other has low shirt-collars, but long hair to bide his skull.\\nIt\\'s all too neat and correct, Monsieur, and there\\'s something wrong.\\nThings made so opposite are things that cannot quarrel.\\nWherever the one sticks out the other sinks in.  Like a face and a mask,\\nlike a lock and a key...\"\\n\\n     Flambeau was peering into the house with a visage as white as a sheet.\\nThe occupant of the room was standing with his back to him,\\nbut in front of a looking-glass, and had already fitted round his face\\na sort of framework of rank red hair, hanging disordered from the head and\\nclinging round the jaws and chin while leaving the mocking mouth uncovered.\\nSeen thus in the glass the white face looked like the face of Judas\\nlaughing horribly and surrounded by capering flames of hell.\\nFor a spasm Flambeau saw the fierce, red-brown eyes dancing,\\nthen they were covered with a pair of blue spectacles.  Slipping on\\na loose black coat, the figure vanished towards the front of the house.\\nA few moments later a roar of popular applause from the street beyond\\nannounced that Dr Hirsch had once more appeared upon the balcony.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. The Man in the Passage\\n\\n\\nTWO men appeared simultaneously at the two ends of a sort of passage\\nrunning along the side of the Apollo Theatre in the Adelphi.\\nThe evening daylight in the streets was large and luminous,\\nopalescent and empty.  The passage was comparatively long and dark,\\nso each man could see the other as a mere black silhouette at the other end.\\nNevertheless, each man knew the other, even in that inky outline;\\nfor they were both men of striking appearance and they hated each other.\\n\\n     The covered passage opened at one end on one of the steep streets\\nof the Adelphi, and at the other on a terrace overlooking\\nthe sunset-coloured river.  One side of the passage was a blank wall,\\nfor the building it supported was an old unsuccessful theatre restaurant,\\nnow shut up.  The other side of the passage contained two doors,\\none at each end.  Neither was what was commonly called the stage door;\\nthey were a sort of special and private stage doors used by\\nvery special performers, and in this case by the star actor\\nand actress in the Shakespearean performance of the day.\\nPersons of that eminence often like to have such private exits\\nand entrances, for meeting friends or avoiding them.\\n\\n     The two men in question were certainly two such friends,\\nmen who evidently knew the doors and counted on their opening,\\nfor each approached the door at the upper end with equal coolness\\nand confidence.  Not, however, with equal speed; but the man\\nwho walked fast was the man from the other end of the tunnel,\\nso they both arrived before the secret stage door almost at\\nthe same instant.  They saluted each other with civility,\\nand waited a moment before one of them, the sharper walker\\nwho seemed to have the shorter patience, knocked at the door.\\n\\n     In this and everything else each man was opposite and neither\\ncould be called inferior.  As private persons both were handsome,\\ncapable and popular.  As public persons, both were in the first public rank.\\nBut everything about them, from their glory to their good looks,\\nwas of a diverse and incomparable kind.  Sir Wilson Seymour was\\nthe kind of man whose importance is known to everybody who knows.\\nThe more you mixed with the innermost ring in every polity or profession,\\nthe more  often you met Sir Wilson Seymour.  He was the one intelligent man\\non twenty unintelligent committees--on every sort of subject,\\nfrom the reform of the Royal Academy to the project of bimetallism\\nfor Greater Britain.  In the Arts especially he was omnipotent.\\nHe was so unique that nobody could quite decide whether he was\\na great aristocrat who had taken up Art, or a great artist whom\\nthe aristocrats had taken up.  But you could not meet him for five minutes\\nwithout realizing that you had really been ruled by him all your life.\\n\\n     His appearance was \"distinguished\" in exactly the same sense;\\nit was at once conventional and unique.  Fashion could have found no fault\\nwith his high silk hat--, yet it was unlike anyone else\\'s hat--\\na little higher, perhaps, and adding something to his natural height.\\nHis tall, slender figure had a slight stoop yet it looked\\nthe reverse of feeble.  His hair was silver-grey, but he did not look old;\\nit was worn longer than the common yet he did not look effeminate;\\nit was curly but it did not look curled.  His carefully pointed beard\\nmade him look more manly and militant than otherwise, as it does in those\\nold admirals of Velazquez with whose dark portraits his house was hung.\\nHis grey gloves were a shade bluer, his silver-knobbed cane a shade longer\\nthan scores of such gloves and canes flapped and flourished about\\nthe theatres and the restaurants.\\n\\n     The other man was not so tall, yet would have struck nobody as short,\\nbut merely as strong and handsome.  His hair also was curly,\\nbut fair and cropped close to a strong, massive head--the sort of head\\nyou break a door with, as Chaucer said of the Miller\\'s.\\nHis military moustache and the carriage of his shoulders\\nshowed him a soldier, but he had a pair of those peculiar frank\\nand piercing blue eyes which are more common in sailors.\\nHis face was somewhat square, his jaw was square, his shoulders\\nwere square, even his jacket was square.  Indeed, in the wild school\\nof caricature then current, Mr Max Beerbohm had represented him as\\na proposition in the fourth book of Euclid.\\n\\n     For he also was a public man, though with quite another\\nsort of success.  You did not have to be in the best society\\nto have heard of Captain Cutler, of the siege of Hong-Kong,\\nand the great march across China.  You could not get away from\\nhearing of him wherever you were; his portrait was on every other postcard;\\nhis maps and battles in every other illustrated paper; songs in his honour\\nin every other music-hall turn or on every other barrel-organ.\\nHis fame, though probably more temporary, was ten times more wide,\\npopular and spontaneous than the other man\\'s.  In thousands of\\nEnglish homes he appeared enormous above England, like Nelson.\\nYet he had infinitely less power in England than Sir Wilson Seymour.\\n\\n     The door was opened to them by an aged servant or \"dresser\",\\nwhose broken-down face and figure and black shabby coat and trousers\\ncontrasted queerly with the glittering interior of the great actress\\'s\\ndressing-room.  It was fitted and filled with looking-glasses\\nat every angle of refraction, so that they looked like the hundred facets\\nof one huge diamond--if one could get inside a diamond.\\nThe other features of luxury, a few flowers, a few coloured cushions,\\na few scraps of stage costume, were multiplied by all the mirrors into\\nthe madness of the Arabian Nights, and danced and changed places\\nperpetually as the shuffling attendant shifted a mirror outwards\\nor shot one back against the wall.\\n\\n     They both spoke to the dingy dresser by name, calling him Parkinson,\\nand asking for the lady as Miss Aurora Rome.  Parkinson said she was\\nin the other room, but he would go and tell her.  A shade crossed the brow\\nof both visitors; for the other room was the private room of\\nthe great actor with whom Miss Aurora was performing, and she was\\nof the kind that does not inflame admiration without inflaming jealousy.\\nIn about half a minute, however, the inner door opened, and she entered\\nas she always did, even in private life, so that the very silence\\nseemed to be a roar of applause, and one well-deserved.\\nShe was clad in a somewhat strange garb of peacock green and\\npeacock blue satins, that gleamed like blue and green metals,\\nsuch as delight children and aesthetes, and her heavy, hot brown hair\\nframed one of those magic faces which are dangerous to all men,\\nbut especially to boys and to men growing grey.  In company with\\nher male colleague, the great American actor, Isidore Bruno,\\nshe was producing a particularly poetical and fantastic interpretation\\nof Midsummer Night\\'s Dream:  in which the artistic prominence was given\\nto Oberon and Titania, or in other words to Bruno and herself.\\nSet in dreamy and exquisite scenery, and moving in mystical dances,\\nthe green costume, like burnished beetle-wings, expressed all the\\nelusive individuality of an elfin queen.  But when personally confronted\\nin what was still broad daylight, a man looked only at the woman\\'s face.\\n\\n     She greeted both men with the beaming and baffling smile\\nwhich kept so many males at the same just dangerous distance from her.\\nShe accepted some flowers from Cutler, which were as tropical and expensive\\nas his victories; and another sort of present from Sir Wilson Seymour,\\noffered later on and more nonchalantly by that gentleman.\\nFor it was against his breeding to show eagerness, and against his\\nconventional unconventionality to give anything so obvious as flowers.\\nHe had picked up a trifle, he said, which was rather a curiosity,\\nit was an ancient Greek dagger of the Mycenaean Epoch, and might well\\nhave been worn in the time of Theseus and Hippolyta.  It was made of brass\\nlike all the Heroic weapons, but, oddly enough, sharp enough\\nto prick anyone still.  He had really been attracted to it by\\nthe leaf-like shape; it was as perfect as a Greek vase.\\nIf it was of any interest to Miss Rome or could come in anywhere\\nin the play, he hoped she would--\\n\\n     The inner door burst open and a big figure appeared, who was\\nmore of a contrast to the explanatory Seymour than even Captain Cutler.\\nNearly six-foot-six, and of more than theatrical thews and muscles,\\nIsidore Bruno, in the gorgeous leopard skin and golden-brown garments\\nof Oberon, looked like a barbaric god.  He leaned on a sort of\\nhunting-spear, which across a theatre looked a slight, silvery wand,\\nbut which in the small and comparatively crowded room looked as plain as\\na pike-staff--and as menacing.  His vivid black eyes rolled volcanically,\\nhis bronzed face, handsome as it was, showed at that moment\\na combination of high cheekbones with set white teeth, which recalled\\ncertain American conjectures about his origin in the Southern plantations.\\n\\n     \"Aurora,\" he began, in that deep voice like a drum of passion\\nthat had moved so many audiences, \"will you--\"\\n\\n     He stopped indecisively because a sixth figure had suddenly\\npresented itself just inside the doorway--a figure so incongruous\\nin the scene as to be almost comic.  It was a very short man in\\nthe black uniform of the Roman secular clergy, and looking\\n(especially in such a presence as Bruno\\'s and Aurora\\'s) rather like\\nthe wooden Noah out of an ark.  He did not, however, seem conscious\\nof any contrast, but said with dull civility: \"I believe Miss Rome\\nsent for me.\"\\n\\n     A shrewd observer might have remarked that the emotional temperature\\nrather rose at so unemotional an interruption.  The detachment of\\na professional celibate seemed to reveal to the others that they\\nstood round the woman as a ring of amorous rivals; just as a stranger\\ncoming in with frost on his coat will reveal that a room is like a furnace.\\nThe presence of the one man who did not care about her\\nincreased Miss Rome\\'s sense that everybody else was in love with her,\\nand each in a somewhat dangerous way:  the actor with all the appetite\\nof a savage and a spoilt child; the soldier with all the simple selfishness\\nof a man of will rather than mind; Sir Wilson with that daily hardening\\nconcentration with which old Hedonists take to a hobby; nay,\\neven the abject Parkinson, who had known her before her triumphs,\\nand who followed her about the room with eyes or feet,\\nwith the dumb fascination of a dog.\\n\\n     A shrewd person might also have noted a yet odder thing.\\nThe man like a black wooden Noah (who was not wholly without shrewdness)\\nnoted it with a considerable but contained amusement.  It was evident\\nthat the great Aurora, though by no means indifferent to the admiration\\nof the other sex, wanted at this moment to get rid of all the men\\nwho admired her and be left alone with the man who did not--\\ndid not admire her in that sense at least; for the little priest\\ndid admire and even enjoy the firm feminine diplomacy with which\\nshe set about her task.  There was, perhaps, only one thing\\nthat Aurora Rome was clever about, and that was one half of humanity--\\nthe other half.  The little priest watched, like a Napoleonic campaign,\\nthe swift precision of her policy for expelling all while banishing none.\\nBruno, the big actor, was so babyish that it was easy to send him off\\nin brute sulks, banging the door.  Cutler, the British officer,\\nwas pachydermatous to ideas, but punctilious about behaviour.\\nHe would ignore all hints, but he would die rather than\\nignore a definite commission from a lady.  As to old Seymour,\\nhe had to be treated differently; he had to be left to the last.\\nThe only way to move him was to appeal to him in confidence as an old\\nfriend, to let him into the secret of the clearance.  The priest did\\nreally admire Miss Rome as she achieved all these three objects\\nin one selected action.\\n\\n     She went across to Captain Cutler and said in her sweetest manner:\\n\"I shall value all these flowers, because they must be your\\nfavourite flowers.  But they won\\'t be complete, you know,\\nwithout my favourite flower.  Do go over to that shop round the corner\\nand get me some lilies-of-the-valley, and then it will be quite lovely.\"\\n\\n     The first object of her diplomacy, the exit of the enraged Bruno,\\nwas at once achieved.  He had already handed his spear in a lordly style,\\nlike a sceptre, to the piteous Parkinson, and was about to assume\\none of the cushioned seats like a throne.  But at this open appeal to\\nhis rival there glowed in his opal eyeballs all the sensitive insolence\\nof the slave; he knotted his enormous brown fists for an instant,\\nand then, dashing open the door, disappeared into his own apartments beyond.\\nBut meanwhile Miss Rome\\'s experiment in mobilizing the British Army\\nhad not succeeded so simply as seemed probable.  Cutler had indeed\\nrisen stiffly and suddenly, and walked towards the door, hatless,\\nas if at a word of command.  But perhaps there was something\\nostentatiously elegant about the languid figure of Seymour leaning against\\none of the looking-glasses that brought him up short at the entrance,\\nturning his head this way and that like a bewildered bulldog.\\n\\n     \"I must show this stupid man where to go,\" said Aurora\\nin a whisper to Seymour, and ran out to the threshold to speed\\nthe parting guest.\\n\\n     Seymour seemed to be listening, elegant and unconscious\\nas was his posture, and he seemed relieved when he heard the lady call out\\nsome last instructions to the Captain, and then turn sharply\\nand run laughing down the passage towards the other end,\\nthe end on the terrace above the Thames.  Yet a second or two after\\nSeymour\\'s brow darkened again.  A man in his position has so many rivals,\\nand he remembered that at the other end of the passage was\\nthe corresponding entrance to Bruno\\'s private room.  He did not\\nlose his dignity; he said some civil words to Father Brown\\nabout the revival of Byzantine architecture in the Westminster Cathedral,\\nand then, quite naturally, strolled out himself into the upper end\\nof the passage.  Father Brown and Parkinson were left alone,\\nand they were neither of them men with a taste for superfluous conversation.\\nThe dresser went round the room, pulling out looking-glasses\\nand pushing them in again, his dingy dark coat and trousers looking\\nall the more dismal since he was still holding the festive fairy spear\\nof King Oberon.  Every time he pulled out the frame of a new glass,\\na new black figure of Father Brown appeared; the absurd glass chamber\\nwas full of Father Browns, upside down in the air like angels,\\nturning somersaults like acrobats, turning their backs to everybody\\nlike very rude persons.\\n\\n     Father Brown seemed quite unconscious of this cloud of witnesses,\\nbut followed Parkinson with an idly attentive eye till he took himself\\nand his absurd spear into the farther room of Bruno.  Then he abandoned\\nhimself to such abstract meditations as always amused him--\\ncalculating the angles of the mirrors, the angles of each refraction,\\nthe angle at which each must fit into the wall...when he heard\\na strong but strangled cry.\\n\\n     He sprang to his feet and stood rigidly listening.\\nAt the same instant Sir Wilson Seymour burst back into the room,\\nwhite as ivory.  \"Who\\'s that man in the passage?\" he cried.\\n\"Where\\'s that dagger of mine?\"\\n\\n     Before Father Brown could turn in his heavy boots Seymour was\\nplunging about the room looking for the weapon.  And before he could\\npossibly find that weapon or any other, a brisk running of feet\\nbroke upon the pavement outside, and the square face of Cutler\\nwas thrust into the same doorway.  He was still grotesquely grasping\\na bunch of lilies-of-the-valley.  \"What\\'s this?\" he cried.\\n\"What\\'s that creature down the passage?  Is this some of your tricks?\"\\n\\n     \"My tricks!\" hissed his pale rival, and made a stride towards him.\\n\\n     In the instant of time in which all this happened Father Brown\\nstepped out into the top of the passage, looked down it,\\nand at once walked briskly towards what he saw.\\n\\n     At this the other two men dropped their quarrel and darted after him,\\nCutler calling out:  \"What are you doing?  Who are you?\"\\n\\n     \"My name is Brown,\" said the priest sadly, as he bent over something\\nand straightened himself again.  \"Miss Rome sent for me,\\nand I came as quickly as I could.  I have come too late.\"\\n\\n     The three men looked down, and in one of them at least\\nthe life died in that late light of afternoon.  It ran along\\nthe passage like a path of gold, and in the midst of it Aurora Rome lay\\nlustrous in her robes of green and gold, with her dead face\\nturned upwards.  Her dress was torn away as in a struggle,\\nleaving the right shoulder bare, but the wound from which\\nthe blood was welling was on the other side.  The brass dagger\\nlay flat and gleaming a yard or so away.\\n\\n     There was a blank stillness for a measurable time, so that\\nthey could hear far off a flower-girl\\'s laugh outside Charing Cross,\\nand someone whistling furiously for a taxicab in one of the streets\\noff the Strand.  Then the Captain, with a movement so sudden that it\\nmight have been passion or play-acting, took Sir Wilson Seymour by the\\nthroat.\\n\\n     Seymour looked at him steadily without either fight or fear.\\n\"You need not kill me,\" he said in a voice quite cold; \"I shall do\\nthat on my own account.\"\\n\\n     The Captain\\'s hand hesitated and dropped; and the other added\\nwith the same icy candour:  \"If I find I haven\\'t the nerve\\nto do it with that dagger I can do it in a month with drink.\"\\n\\n     \"Drink isn\\'t good enough for me,\" replied Cutler, \"but I\\'ll have\\nblood for this before I die.  Not yours--but I think I know whose.\"\\n\\n     And before the others could appreciate his intention\\nhe snatched up the dagger, sprang at the other door at the lower end\\nof the passage, burst it open, bolt and all, and confronted Bruno\\nin his dressing-room.  As he did so, old Parkinson tottered\\nin his wavering way out of the door and caught sight of the corpse\\nlying in the passage.  He moved shakily towards it; looked at it weakly\\nwith a working face; then moved shakily back into the dressing-room again,\\nand sat down suddenly on one of the richly cushioned chairs.\\nFather Brown instantly ran across to him, taking no notice of Cutler\\nand the colossal actor, though the room already rang with their blows\\nand they began to struggle for the dagger.  Seymour, who retained some\\npractical sense, was whistling for the police at the end of the passage.\\n\\n     When the police arrived it was to tear the two men\\nfrom an almost ape-like grapple; and, after a few formal inquiries,\\nto arrest Isidore Bruno upon a charge of murder, brought against him\\nby his furious opponent.  The idea that the great national hero of the hour\\nhad arrested a wrongdoer with his own hand doubtless had its weight\\nwith the police, who are not without elements of the journalist.\\nThey treated Cutler with a certain solemn attention, and pointed out\\nthat he had got a slight slash on the hand.  Even as Cutler\\nbore him back across tilted chair and table, Bruno had twisted\\nthe dagger out of his grasp and disabled him just below the wrist.\\nThe injury was really slight, but till he was removed from the room\\nthe half-savage prisoner stared at the running blood with a steady smile.\\n\\n     \"Looks a cannibal sort of chap, don\\'t he?\" said the constable\\nconfidentially to Cutler.\\n\\n     Cutler made no answer, but said sharply a moment after:\\n\"We must attend to the...the death...\" and his voice escaped\\nfrom articulation.\\n\\n     \"The two deaths,\" came in the voice of the priest from\\nthe farther side of the room.  \"This poor fellow was gone\\nwhen I got across to him.\" And he stood looking down at old Parkinson,\\nwho sat in a black huddle on the gorgeous chair.  He also had\\npaid his tribute, not without eloquence, to the woman who had died.\\n\\n     The silence was first broken by Cutler, who seemed not untouched\\nby a rough tenderness.  \"I wish I was him,\" he said huskily.\\n\"I remember he used to watch her wherever she walked more than--anybody.\\nShe was his air, and he\\'s dried up.  He\\'s just dead.\"\\n\\n     \"We are all dead,\" said Seymour in a strange voice,\\nlooking down the road.\\n\\n     They took leave of Father Brown at the corner of the road,\\nwith some random apologies for any rudeness they might have shown.\\nBoth their faces were tragic, but also cryptic.\\n\\n     The mind of the little priest was always a rabbit-warren\\nof wild thoughts that jumped too quickly for him to catch them.\\nLike the white tail of a rabbit he had the vanishing thought that\\nhe was certain of their grief, but not so certain of their innocence.\\n\\n     \"We had better all be going,\" said Seymour heavily; \"we have done\\nall we can to help.\"\\n\\n     \"Will you understand my motives,\" asked Father Brown quietly,\\n\"if I say you have done all you can to hurt?\"\\n\\n     They both started as if guiltily, and Cutler said sharply:\\n\"To hurt whom?\"\\n\\n     \"To hurt yourselves,\" answered the priest.  \"I would not\\nadd to your troubles if it weren\\'t common justice to warn you.\\nYou\\'ve done nearly everything you could do to hang yourselves,\\nif this actor should be acquitted.  They\\'ll be sure to subpoena me;\\nI shall be bound to say that after the cry was heard each of you\\nrushed into the room in a wild state and began quarrelling about a dagger.\\nAs far as my words on oath can go, you might either of you have done it.\\nYou hurt yourselves with that; and then Captain Cutler must have\\nhurt himself with the dagger.\"\\n\\n     \"Hurt myself!\" exclaimed the Captain, with contempt.\\n\"A silly little scratch.\"\\n\\n     \"Which drew blood,\" replied the priest, nodding.  \"We know there\\'s\\nblood on the brass now.  And so we shall never know whether there was\\nblood on it before.\"\\n\\n     There was a silence; and then Seymour said, with an emphasis\\nquite alien to his daily accent:  \"But I saw a man in the passage.\"\\n\\n     \"I know you did,\" answered the cleric Brown with a face of wood,\\n\"so did Captain Cutler.  That\\'s what seems so improbable.\"\\n\\n     Before either could make sufficient sense of it even to answer,\\nFather Brown had politely excused himself and gone stumping\\nup the road with his stumpy old umbrella.\\n\\n     As modern newspapers are conducted, the most honest\\nand most important news is the police news.  If it be true that\\nin the twentieth century more space is given to murder than to politics,\\nit is for the excellent reason that murder is a more serious subject.\\nBut even this would hardly explain the enormous omnipresence and\\nwidely distributed detail of \"The Bruno Case,\" or \"The Passage Mystery,\"\\nin the Press of London and the provinces.  So vast was the excitement\\nthat for some weeks the Press really told the truth; and the reports\\nof examination and cross-examination, if interminable,\\neven if intolerable are at least reliable.  The true reason,\\nof course, was the coincidence of persons.  The victim was\\na popular actress; the accused was a popular actor; and the accused\\nhad been caught red-handed, as it were, by the most popular soldier\\nof the patriotic season.  In those extraordinary circumstances\\nthe Press was paralysed into probity and accuracy; and the rest of this\\nsomewhat singular business can practically be recorded from reports\\nof Bruno\\'s trial.\\n\\n     The trial was presided over by Mr Justice Monkhouse,\\none of those who are jeered at as humorous judges, but who are generally\\nmuch more serious than the serious judges, for their levity comes from\\na living impatience of professional solemnity; while the serious judge\\nis really filled with frivolity, because he is filled with vanity.\\nAll the chief actors being of a worldly importance, the barristers\\nwere well balanced; the prosecutor for the Crown was Sir Walter Cowdray,\\na heavy, but weighty advocate of the sort that knows how to seem\\nEnglish and trustworthy, and how to be rhetorical with reluctance.\\nThe prisoner was defended by Mr Patrick Butler, K.C., who was mistaken\\nfor a mere flaneur by those who misunderstood the Irish character--\\nand those who had not been examined by him.  The medical evidence\\ninvolved no contradictions, the doctor, whom Seymour had summoned\\non the spot, agreeing with the eminent surgeon who had later\\nexamined the body.  Aurora Rome had been stabbed with some sharp instrument\\nsuch as a knife or dagger; some instrument, at least, of which\\nthe blade was short.  The wound was just over the heart, and she had\\ndied instantly.  When the doctor first saw her she could hardly\\nhave been dead for twenty minutes.  Therefore when Father Brown\\nfound her she could hardly have been dead for three.\\n\\n     Some official detective evidence followed, chiefly concerned with\\nthe presence or absence of any proof of a struggle; the only suggestion\\nof this was the tearing of the dress at the shoulder, and this did not seem\\nto fit in particularly well with the direction and finality of the blow.\\nWhen these details had been supplied, though not explained,\\nthe first of the important witnesses was called.\\n\\n     Sir Wilson Seymour gave evidence as he did everything else\\nthat he did at all--not only well, but perfectly.  Though himself\\nmuch more of a public man than the judge, he conveyed exactly\\nthe fine shade of self-effacement before the King\\'s justice;\\nand though everyone looked at him as they would at the Prime Minister\\nor the Archbishop of Canterbury, they could have said nothing\\nof his part in it but that it was that of a private gentleman,\\nwith an accent on the noun.  He was also refreshingly lucid,\\nas he was on the committees.  He had been calling on Miss Rome\\nat the theatre; he had met Captain Cutler there; they had been joined\\nfor a short time by the accused, who had then returned to his\\nown dressing-room; they had then been joined by a Roman Catholic priest,\\nwho asked for the deceased lady and said his name was Brown.\\nMiss Rome had then gone just outside the theatre to the entrance\\nof the passage, in order to point out to Captain Cutler a flower-shop\\nat which he was to buy her some more flowers; and the witness\\nhad remained in the room, exchanging a few words with the priest.\\nHe had then distinctly heard the deceased, having sent the Captain\\non his errand, turn round laughing and run down the passage\\ntowards its other end, where was the prisoner\\'s dressing-room.\\nIn idle curiosity as to the rapid movement of his friends,\\nhe had strolled out to the head of the passage himself and looked down it\\ntowards the prisoner\\'s door.  Did he see anything in the passage?\\nYes; he saw something in the passage.\\n\\n     Sir Walter Cowdray allowed an impressive interval,\\nduring which the witness looked down, and for all his usual composure\\nseemed to have more than his usual pallor.  Then the barrister said\\nin a lower voice, which seemed at once sympathetic and creepy:\\n\"Did you see it distinctly?\"\\n\\n     Sir Wilson Seymour, however moved, had his excellent brains\\nin full working-order.  \"Very distinctly as regards its outline,\\nbut quite indistinctly, indeed not at all, as regards the details\\ninside the outline.  The passage is of such length that anyone in\\nthe middle of it appears quite black against the light at the other end.\"\\nThe witness lowered his steady eyes once more and added:\\n\"I had noticed the fact before, when Captain Cutler first entered it.\"\\nThere was another silence, and the judge leaned forward and made a note.\\n\\n     \"Well,\" said Sir Walter patiently, \"what was the outline like?\\nWas it, for instance, like the figure of the murdered woman?\"\\n\\n     \"Not in the least,\" answered Seymour quietly.\\n\\n     \"What did it look like to you?\"\\n\\n     \"It looked to me,\" replied the witness, \"like a tall man.\"\\n\\n     Everyone in court kept his eyes riveted on his pen,\\nor his umbrella-handle, or his book, or his boots or whatever\\nhe happened to be looking at.  They seemed to be holding their eyes\\naway from the prisoner by main force; but they felt his figure in the dock,\\nand they felt it as gigantic.  Tall as Bruno was to the eye,\\nhe seemed to swell taller and taller when an eyes had been\\ntorn away from him.\\n\\n     Cowdray was resuming his seat with his solemn face,\\nsmoothing his black silk robes, and white silk whiskers.\\nSir Wilson was leaving the witness-box, after a few final particulars\\nto which there were many other witnesses, when the counsel for the defence\\nsprang up and stopped him.\\n\\n     \"I shall only detain you a moment,\" said Mr Butler,\\nwho was a rustic-looking person with red eyebrows and an expression\\nof partial slumber.  \"Will you tell his lordship how you knew\\nit was a man?\"\\n\\n     A faint, refined smile seemed to pass over Seymour\\'s features.\\n\"I\\'m afraid it is the vulgar test of trousers,\" he said.\\n\"When I saw daylight between the long legs I was sure it was a man,\\nafter all.\"\\n\\n     Butler\\'s sleepy eyes opened as suddenly as some silent explosion.\\n\"After all!\" he repeated slowly.  \"So you did think at first\\nit was a woman?\"\\n\\n     Seymour looked troubled for the first time.  \"It is hardly\\na point of fact,\" he said, \"but if his lordship would like me\\nto answer for my impression, of course I shall do so.  There was something\\nabout the thing that was not exactly a woman and yet was not quite a man;\\nsomehow the curves were different.  And it had something that looked like\\nlong hair.\"\\n\\n     \"Thank you,\" said Mr Butler, K.C., and sat down suddenly,\\nas if he had got what he wanted.\\n\\n     Captain Cutler was a far less plausible and composed witness\\nthan Sir Wilson, but his account of the opening incidents was\\nsolidly the same.  He described the return of Bruno to his dressing-room,\\nthe dispatching of himself to buy a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley,\\nhis return to the upper end of the passage, the thing he saw\\nin the passage, his suspicion of Seymour, and his struggle with Bruno.\\nBut he could give little artistic assistance about the black figure\\nthat he and Seymour had seen.  Asked about its outline, he said he\\nwas no art critic--with a somewhat too obvious sneer at Seymour.\\nAsked if it was a man or a woman, he said it looked more like a beast--\\nwith a too obvious snarl at the prisoner.  But the man was plainly shaken\\nwith sorrow and sincere anger, and Cowdray quickly excused him\\nfrom confirming facts that were already fairly clear.\\n\\n     The defending counsel also was again brief in his cross-examination;\\nalthough (as was his custom) even in being brief, he seemed to take\\na long time about it.  \"You used a rather remarkable expression,\" he said,\\nlooking at Cutler sleepily.  \"What do you mean by saying that\\nit looked more like a beast than a man or a woman?\"\\n\\n     Cutler seemed seriously agitated.  \"Perhaps I oughtn\\'t to have\\nsaid that,\" he said; \"but when the brute has huge humped shoulders\\nlike a chimpanzee, and bristles sticking out of its head like a pig--\"\\n\\n     Mr Butler cut short his curious impatience in the middle.\\n\"Never mind whether its hair was like a pig\\'s,\" he said,\\n\"was it like a woman\\'s?\"\\n\\n     \"A woman\\'s!\" cried the soldier.  \"Great Scott, no!\"\\n\\n     \"The last witness said it was,\" commented the counsel,\\nwith unscrupulous swiftness.  \"And did the figure have any of those\\nserpentine and semi-feminine curves to which eloquent allusion\\nhas been made?  No?  No feminine curves?  The figure, if I understand you,\\nwas rather heavy and square than otherwise?\"\\n\\n     \"He may have been bending forward,\" said Cutler, in a hoarse\\nand rather faint voice.\\n\\n     \"Or again, he may not,\" said Mr Butler, and sat down suddenly\\nfor the second time.\\n\\n     The third, witness called by Sir Walter Cowdray was\\nthe little Catholic clergyman, so little, compared with the others,\\nthat his head seemed hardly to come above the box, so that it was like\\ncross-examining a child.  But unfortunately Sir Walter had somehow\\ngot it into his head (mostly by some ramifications of his family\\'s religion)\\nthat Father Brown was on the side of the prisoner, because the prisoner\\nwas wicked and foreign and even partly black.  Therefore he\\ntook Father Brown up sharply whenever that proud pontiff tried\\nto explain anything; and told him to answer yes or no, and tell\\nthe plain facts without any jesuitry.  When Father Brown began,\\nin his simplicity, to say who he thought the man in the passage was,\\nthe barrister told him that he did not want his theories.\\n\\n     \"A black shape was seen in the passage.  And you say you saw\\nthe black shape.  Well, what shape was it?\"\\n\\n     Father Brown blinked as under rebuke; but he had long known\\nthe literal nature of obedience.  \"The shape,\" he said, \"was short\\nand thick, but had two sharp, black projections curved upwards\\non each side of the head or top, rather like horns, and--\"\\n\\n     \"Oh! the devil with horns, no doubt,\" ejaculated Cowdray,\\nsitting down in triumphant jocularity.  \"It was the devil come\\nto eat Protestants.\"\\n\\n     \"No,\" said the priest dispassionately; \"I know who it was.\"\\n\\n     Those in court had been wrought up to an irrational,\\nbut real sense of some monstrosity.  They had forgotten the figure\\nin the dock and thought only of the figure in the passage.\\nAnd the figure in the passage, described by three capable\\nand respectable men who had all seen it, was a shifting nightmare:\\none called it a woman, and the other a beast, and the other a devil....\\n\\n     The judge was looking at Father Brown with level and piercing eyes.\\n\"You are a most extraordinary witness,\" he said; \"but there is something\\nabout you that makes me think you are trying to tell the truth.\\nWell, who was the man you saw in the passage?\"\\n\\n     \"He was myself,\" said Father Brown.\\n\\n     Butler, K.C., sprang to his feet in an extraordinary stillness,\\nand said quite calmly:  \"Your lordship will allow me to cross-examine?\"\\nAnd then, without stopping, he shot at Brown the apparently\\ndisconnected question:  \"You have heard about this dagger;\\nyou know the experts say the crime was committed with a short blade?\"\\n\\n     \"A short blade,\" assented Brown, nodding solemnly like an owl,\\n\"but a very long hilt.\"\\n\\n     Before the audience could quite dismiss the idea that the priest\\nhad really seen himself doing murder with a short dagger with a long hilt\\n(which seemed somehow to make it more horrible), he had himself\\nhurried on to explain.\\n\\n     \"I mean daggers aren\\'t the only things with short blades.\\nSpears have short blades.  And spears catch at the end of the steel\\njust like daggers, if they\\'re that sort of fancy spear they had\\nin theatres; like the spear poor old Parkinson killed his wife with,\\njust when she\\'d sent for me to settle their family troubles--\\nand I came just too late, God forgive me!  But he died penitent--\\nhe just died of being penitent.  He couldn\\'t bear what he\\'d done.\"\\n\\n     The general impression in court was that the little priest,\\nwho was gobbling away, had literally gone mad in the box.\\nBut the judge still looked at him with bright and steady eyes of interest;\\nand the counsel for the defence went on with his questions unperturbed.\\n\\n     \"If Parkinson did it with that pantomime spear,\" said Butler,\\n\"he must have thrust from four yards away.  How do you account for\\nsigns of struggle, like the dress dragged off the shoulder?\" He had\\nslipped into treating his mere witness as an expert; but no one\\nnoticed it now.\\n\\n     \"The poor lady\\'s dress was torn,\" said the witness,\\n\"because it was caught in a panel that slid to just behind her.\\nShe struggled to free herself, and as she did so Parkinson came out\\nof the prisoner\\'s room and lunged with the spear.\"\\n\\n     \"A panel?\" repeated the barrister in a curious voice.\\n\\n     \"It was a looking-glass on the other side,\" explained Father Brown.\\n\"When I was in the dressing-room I noticed that some of them\\ncould probably be slid out into the passage.\"\\n\\n     There was another vast and unnatural silence, and this time\\nit was the judge who spoke.  \"So you really mean that when you\\nlooked down that passage, the man you saw was yourself--in a mirror?\"\\n\\n     \"Yes, my lord; that was what I was trying to say,\" said Brown,\\n\"but they asked me for the shape; and our hats have corners\\njust like horns, and so I--\"\\n\\n     The judge leaned forward, his old eyes yet more brilliant,\\nand said in specially distinct tones:  \"Do you really mean to say that\\nwhen Sir Wilson Seymour saw that wild what-you-call-him with curves\\nand a woman\\'s hair and a man\\'s trousers, what he saw was\\nSir Wilson Seymour?\"\\n\\n     \"Yes, my lord,\" said Father Brown.\\n\\n     \"And you mean to say that when Captain Cutler saw that chimpanzee\\nwith humped shoulders and hog\\'s bristles, he simply saw himself?\"\\n\\n     \"Yes, my lord.\"\\n\\n     The judge leaned back in his chair with a luxuriance in which\\nit was hard to separate the cynicism and the admiration.\\n\"And can you tell us why,\" he asked, \"you should know your own figure\\nin a looking-glass, when two such distinguished men don\\'t?\"\\n\\n     Father Brown blinked even more painfully than before;\\nthen he stammered:  \"Really, my lord, I don\\'t know unless it\\'s because\\nI don\\'t look at it so often.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV. The Mistake of the Machine\\n\\n\\nFLAMBEAU and his friend the priest were sitting in the Temple Gardens\\nabout sunset; and their neighbourhood or some such accidental influence\\nhad turned their talk to matters of legal process.  From the problem\\nof the licence in cross-examination, their talk strayed to Roman and\\nmediaeval torture, to the examining magistrate in France and\\nthe Third Degree in America.\\n\\n     \"I\\'ve been reading,\" said Flambeau, \"of this new psychometric method\\nthey talk about so much, especially in America.  You know what I mean;\\nthey put a pulsometer on a man\\'s wrist and judge by how his heart goes\\nat the pronunciation of certain words.  What do you think of it?\"\\n\\n     \"I think it very interesting,\" replied Father Brown;\\n\"it reminds me of that interesting idea in the Dark Ages that blood\\nwould flow from a corpse if the murderer touched it.\"\\n\\n     \"Do you really mean,\" demanded his friend, \"that you think\\nthe two methods equally valuable?\"\\n\\n     \"I think them equally valueless,\" replied Brown.  \"Blood flows,\\nfast or slow, in dead folk or living, for so many more million reasons\\nthan we can ever know.  Blood will have to flow very funnily;\\nblood will have to flow up the Matterhorn, before I will take it\\nas a sign that I am to shed it.\"\\n\\n     \"The method,\" remarked the other, \"has been guaranteed\\nby some of the greatest American men of science.\"\\n\\n     \"What sentimentalists men of science are!\" exclaimed Father Brown,\\n\"and how much more sentimental must American men of science be!\\nWho but a Yankee would think of proving anything from heart-throbs?\\nWhy, they must be as sentimental as a man who thinks a woman\\nis in love with him if she blushes.  That\\'s a test from\\nthe circulation of the blood, discovered by the immortal Harvey;\\nand a jolly rotten test, too.\"\\n\\n     \"But surely,\" insisted Flambeau, \"it might point pretty straight\\nat something or other.\"\\n\\n     \"There\\'s a disadvantage in a stick pointing straight,\"\\nanswered the other.  \"What is it?  Why, the other end of the stick\\nalways points the opposite way.  It depends whether you\\nget hold of the stick by the right end.  I saw the thing done once\\nand I\\'ve never believed in it since.\" And he proceeded to tell\\nthe story of his disillusionment.\\n\\n     It happened nearly twenty years before, when he was chaplain\\nto his co-religionists in a prison in Chicago--where the Irish population\\ndisplayed a capacity both for crime and penitence which kept him\\ntolerably busy.  The official second-in-command under the Governor\\nwas an ex-detective named Greywood Usher, a cadaverous, careful-spoken\\nYankee philosopher, occasionally varying a very rigid visage\\nwith an odd apologetic grimace.  He liked Father Brown in\\na slightly patronizing way; and Father Brown liked him,\\nthough he heartily disliked his theories.  His theories were\\nextremely complicated and were held with extreme simplicity.\\n\\n     One evening he had sent for the priest, who, according to his custom,\\ntook a seat in silence at a table piled and littered with papers,\\nand waited.  The official selected from the papers a scrap of\\nnewspaper cutting, which he handed across to the cleric,\\nwho read it gravely.  It appeared to be an extract from one of\\nthe pinkest of American Society papers, and ran as follows:\\n\\n     \"Society\\'s brightest widower is once more on the Freak Dinner stunt.\\nAll our exclusive citizens will recall the Perambulator Parade Dinner,\\nin which Last-Trick Todd, at his palatial home at Pilgrim\\'s Pond,\\ncaused so many of our prominent debutantes to look even younger\\nthan their years.  Equally elegant and more miscellaneous and\\nlarge-hearted in social outlook was Last-Trick\\'s show the year previous,\\nthe popular Cannibal Crush Lunch, at which the confections handed round\\nwere sarcastically moulded in the forms of human arms and legs,\\nand during which more than one of our gayest mental gymnasts was heard\\noffering to eat his partner.  The witticism which will inspire\\nthis evening is as yet in Mr Todd\\'s pretty reticent intellect,\\nor locked in the jewelled bosoms of our city\\'s gayest leaders;\\nbut there is talk of a pretty parody of the simple manners and customs\\nat the other end of Society\\'s scale.  This would be all the more telling,\\nas hospitable Todd is entertaining in Lord Falconroy, the famous traveller,\\na true-blooded aristocrat fresh from England\\'s oak-groves.\\nLord Falconroy\\'s travels began before his ancient feudal title\\nwas resurrected, he was in the Republic in his youth, and fashion murmurs\\na sly reason for his return.  Miss Etta Todd is one of our\\ndeep-souled New Yorkers, and comes into an income of nearly\\ntwelve hundred million dollars.\"\\n\\n     \"Well,\" asked Usher, \"does that interest you?\"\\n\\n     \"Why, words rather fail me,\" answered Father Brown.\\n\"I cannot think at this moment of anything in this world that would\\ninterest me less.  And, unless the just anger of the Republic is\\nat last going to electrocute journalists for writing like that,\\nI don\\'t quite see why it should interest you either.\"\\n\\n     \"Ah!\" said Mr Usher dryly, and handing across another\\nscrap of newspaper.  \"Well, does that interest you?\"\\n\\n     The paragraph was headed \"Savage Murder of a Warder.\\nConvict Escapes,\" and ran:  \"Just before dawn this morning\\na shout for help was heard in the Convict Settlement at Sequah\\nin this State.  The authorities, hurrying in the direction of the cry,\\nfound the corpse of the warder who patrols the top of the north wall\\nof the prison, the steepest and most difficult exit, for which one man\\nhas always been found sufficient.  The unfortunate officer had,\\nhowever, been hurled from the high wall, his brains beaten out\\nas with a club, and his gun was missing.  Further inquiries showed that\\none of the cells was empty; it had been occupied by a rather sullen ruffian\\ngiving his name as Oscar Rian.  He was only temporarily detained\\nfor some comparatively trivial assault; but he gave everyone the impression\\nof a man with a black past and a dangerous future.  Finally,\\nwhen daylight bad fully revealed the scene of murder, it was found\\nthat he had written on the wall above the body a fragmentary sentence,\\napparently with a finger dipped in blood:  `This was self-defence and\\nhe had the gun.  I meant no harm to him or any man but one.\\nI am keeping the bullet for Pilgrim\\'s Pond--O.R.\\'  A man must have used\\nmost fiendish treachery or most savage and amazing bodily daring\\nto have stormed such a wall in spite of an armed man.\"\\n\\n     \"Well, the literary style is somewhat improved,\" admitted the priest\\ncheerfully, \"but still I don\\'t see what I can do for you.\\nI should cut a poor figure, with my short legs, running about this State\\nafter an athletic assassin of that sort.  I doubt whether\\nanybody could find him.  The convict settlement at Sequah\\nis thirty miles from here; the country between is wild and tangled enough,\\nand the country beyond, where he will surely have the sense to go,\\nis a perfect no-man\\'s land tumbling away to the prairies.\\nHe may be in any hole or up any tree.\"\\n\\n     \"He isn\\'t in any hole,\" said the governor; \"he isn\\'t up any tree.\"\\n\\n     \"Why, how do you know?\" asked Father Brown, blinking.\\n\\n     \"Would you like to speak to him?\" inquired Usher.\\n\\n     Father Brown opened his innocent eyes wide.  \"He is here?\"\\nhe exclaimed.  \"Why, how did your men get hold of him?\"\\n\\n     \"I got hold of him myself,\" drawled the American, rising and\\nlazily stretching his lanky legs before the fire.  \"I got hold of him\\nwith the crooked end of a walking-stick.  Don\\'t look so surprised.\\nI really did.  You know I sometimes take a turn in the country lanes\\noutside this dismal place; well, I was walking early this evening\\nup a steep lane with dark hedges and grey-looking ploughed fields\\non both sides; and a young moon was up and silvering the road.\\nBy the light of it I saw a man running across the field towards the road;\\nrunning with his body bent and at a good mile-race trot.\\nHe appeared to be much exhausted; but when he came to the thick black hedge\\nhe went through it as if it were made of spiders\\' webs; --or rather\\n(for I heard the strong branches breaking and snapping like bayonets)\\nas if he himself were made of stone.  In the instant in which\\nhe appeared up against the moon, crossing the road, I slung my hooked cane\\nat his legs, tripping him and bringing him down.  Then I blew my whistle\\nlong and loud, and our fellows came running up to secure him.\"\\n\\n     \"It would have been rather awkward,\" remarked Brown,\\n\"if you had found he was a popular athlete practising a mile race.\"\\n\\n     \"He was not,\" said Usher grimly.  \"We soon found out who he was;\\nbut I had guessed it with the first glint of the moon on him.\"\\n\\n     \"You thought it was the runaway convict,\" observed the priest simply,\\n\"because you had read in the newspaper cutting that morning that\\na convict had run away.\"\\n\\n     \"I had somewhat better grounds,\" replied the governor coolly.\\n\"I pass over the first as too simple to be emphasized--\\nI mean that fashionable athletes do not run across ploughed fields\\nor scratch their eyes out in bramble hedges.  Nor do they run\\nall doubled up like a crouching dog.  There were more decisive details\\nto a fairly well-trained eye.  The man was clad in coarse\\nand ragged clothes, but they were something more than merely\\ncoarse and ragged.  They were so ill-fitting as to be quite grotesque;\\neven as he appeared in black outline against the moonrise,\\nthe coat-collar in which his head was buried made him look\\nlike a hunchback, and the long loose sleeves looked as if he had no hands.\\nIt at once occurred to me that he had somehow managed to change\\nhis convict clothes for some confederate\\'s clothes which did not fit him.\\nSecond, there was a pretty stiff wind against which he was running;\\nso that I must have seen the streaky look of blowing hair, if the hair\\nhad not been very short.  Then I remembered that beyond these\\nploughed fields he was crossing lay Pilgrim\\'s Pond, for which\\n(you will remember) the convict was keeping his bullet;\\nand I sent my walking-stick flying.\"\\n\\n     \"A brilliant piece of rapid deduction,\" said Father Brown;\\n\"but had he got a gun?\"\\n\\n     As Usher stopped abruptly in his walk the priest added apologetically:\\n\"I\\'ve been told a bullet is not half so useful without it.\"\\n\\n     \"He had no gun,\" said the other gravely; \"but that was doubtless\\ndue to some very natural mischance or change of plans.  Probably the\\nsame policy that made him change the clothes made him drop the gun;\\nhe began to repent the coat he had left behind him in the blood\\nof his victim.\"\\n\\n     \"Well, that is possible enough,\" answered the priest.\\n\\n     \"And it\\'s hardly worth speculating on,\" said Usher,\\nturning to some other papers, \"for we know it\\'s the man by this time.\"\\n\\n     His clerical friend asked faintly:  \"But how?\"  And Greywood Usher\\nthrew down the newspapers and took up the two press-cuttings again.\\n\\n     \"Well, since you are so obstinate,\" he said, \"let\\'s begin\\nat the beginning.  You will notice that these two cuttings have only\\none thing in common, which is the mention of Pilgrim\\'s Pond,\\nthe estate, as you know, of the millionaire Ireton Todd.\\nYou also know that he is a remarkable character; one of those\\nthat rose on stepping-stones--\"\\n\\n     \"Of our dead selves to higher things,\" assented his companion.\\n\"Yes; I know that.  Petroleum, I think.\"\\n\\n     \"Anyhow,\" said Usher, \"Last-Trick Todd counts for a great deal\\nin this rum affair.\"\\n\\n     He stretched himself once more before the fire and continued talking\\nin his expansive, radiantly explanatory style.\\n\\n     \"To begin with, on the face of it, there is no mystery here at all.\\nIt is not mysterious, it is not even odd, that a jailbird should\\ntake his gun to Pilgrim\\'s Pond.  Our people aren\\'t like the English,\\nwho will forgive a man for being rich if he throws away money\\non hospitals or horses.  Last-Trick Todd has made himself big\\nby his own considerable abilities; and there\\'s no doubt that\\nmany of those on whom he has shown his abilities would like to\\nshow theirs on him with a shot-gun.  Todd might easily get dropped\\nby some man he\\'d never even heard of; some labourer he\\'d locked out,\\nor some clerk in a business he\\'d busted.  Last-Trick is a man\\nof mental endowments and a high public character; but in this country\\nthe relations of employers and employed are considerably strained.\\n\\n     \"That\\'s how the whole thing looks supposing this Rian\\nmade for Pilgrim\\'s Pond to kill Todd.  So it looked to me,\\ntill another little discovery woke up what I have of the detective in me.\\nWhen I had my prisoner safe, I picked up my cane again and strolled down\\nthe two or three turns of country road that brought me to one of\\nthe side entrances of Todd\\'s grounds, the one nearest to the pool\\nor lake after which the place is named.  It was some two hours ago,\\nabout seven by this time; the moonlight was more luminous,\\nand I could see the long white streaks of it lying on the mysterious mere\\nwith its grey, greasy, half-liquid shores in which they say\\nour fathers used to make witches walk until they sank.\\nI\\'d forgotten the exact tale; but you know the place I mean;\\nit lies north of Todd\\'s house towards the wilderness, and has two queer\\nwrinkled trees, so dismal that they look more like huge fungoids\\nthan decent foliage.  As I stood peering at this misty pool,\\nI fancied I saw the faint figure of a man moving from the house towards it,\\nbut it was all too dim and distant for one to be certain of the fact,\\nand still less of the details.  Besides, my attention was very sharply\\narrested by something much closer.  I crouched behind the fence\\nwhich ran not more than two hundred yards from one wing of\\nthe great mansion, and which was fortunately split in places,\\nas if specially for the application of a cautious eye.  A door had opened\\nin the dark bulk of the left wing, and a figure appeared black against\\nthe illuminated interior--a muffled figure bending forward,\\nevidently peering out into the night.  It closed the door behind it,\\nand I saw it was carrying a lantern, which threw a patch of imperfect light\\non the dress and figure of the wearer.  It seemed to be\\nthe figure of a woman, wrapped up in a ragged cloak and\\nevidently disguised to avoid notice; there was something very strange\\nboth about the rags and the furtiveness in a person coming out of\\nthose rooms lined with gold.  She took cautiously the curved garden path\\nwhich brought her within half a hundred yards of me--, then she stood up\\nfor an instant on the terrace of turf that looks towards the slimy lake,\\nand holding her flaming lantern above her head she deliberately swung it\\nthree times to and fro as for a signal.  As she swung it the second time\\na flicker of its light fell for a moment on her own face,\\na face that I knew.  She was unnaturally pale, and her head was bundled\\nin her borrowed plebeian shawl; but I am certain it was Etta Todd,\\nthe millionaire\\'s daughter.\\n\\n     \"She retraced her steps in equal secrecy and the door\\nclosed behind her again.  I was about to climb the fence and follow,\\nwhen I realized that the detective fever that had lured me\\ninto the adventure was rather undignified; and that in a more\\nauthoritative capacity I already held all the cards in my hand.\\nI was just turning away when a new noise broke on the night.\\nA window was thrown up in one of the upper floors, but just round\\nthe corner of the house so that I could not see it; and a voice\\nof terrible distinctness was heard shouting across the dark garden\\nto know where Lord Falconroy was, for he was missing from every room\\nin the house.  There was no mistaking that voice.  I have\\nheard it on many a political platform or meeting of directors;\\nit was Ireton Todd himself.  Some of the others seemed to have gone\\nto the lower windows or on to the steps, and were calling up to him\\nthat Falconroy had gone for a stroll down to the Pilgrim\\'s Pond\\nan hour before, and could not be traced since.  Then Todd cried\\n`Mighty Murder!\\' and shut down the window violently; and I could hear him\\nplunging down the stairs inside.  Repossessing myself of my former\\nand wiser purpose, I whipped out of the way of the general search\\nthat must follow; and returned here not later than eight o\\'clock.\\n\\n     \"I now ask you to recall that little Society paragraph\\nwhich seemed to you so painfully lacking in interest.  If the convict\\nwas not keeping the shot for Todd, as he evidently wasn\\'t,\\nit is most likely that he was keeping it for Lord Falconroy;\\nand it looks as if he had delivered the goods.  No more handy place\\nto shoot a man than in the curious geological surroundings of that pool,\\nwhere a body thrown down would sink through thick slime to a depth\\npractically unknown.  Let us suppose, then, that our friend\\nwith the cropped hair came to kill Falconroy and not Todd.\\nBut, as I have pointed out, there are many reasons why people in America\\nmight want to kill Todd.  There is no reason why anybody in America\\nshould want to kill an English lord newly landed, except for the one reason\\nmentioned in the pink paper--that the lord is paying his attentions\\nto the millionaire\\'s daughter.  Our crop-haired friend,\\ndespite his ill-fitting clothes, must be an aspiring lover.\\n\\n     \"I know the notion will seem to you jarring and even comic;\\nbut that\\'s because you are English.  It sounds to you like saying\\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury\\'s daughter will be married in\\nSt George\\'s, Hanover Square, to a crossing-sweeper on ticket-of-leave.\\nYou don\\'t do justice to the climbing and aspiring power of our\\nmore remarkable citizens.  You see a good-looking grey-haired man\\nin evening-dress with a sort of authority about him, you know he is\\na pillar of the State, and you fancy he had a father.  You are in error.\\nYou do not realize that a comparatively few years ago he may have been\\nin a tenement or (quite likely) in a jail.  You don\\'t allow for our\\nnational buoyancy and uplift.  Many of our most influential citizens\\nhave not only risen recently, but risen comparatively late in life.\\nTodd\\'s daughter was fully eighteen when her father first made his pile;\\nso there isn\\'t really anything impossible in her having a hanger-on\\nin low life; or even in her hanging on to him, as I think\\nshe must be doing, to judge by the lantern business.  If so,\\nthe hand that held the lantern may not be unconnected with the hand\\nthat held the gun.  This case, sir, will make a noise.\"\\n\\n     \"Well,\" said the priest patiently, \"and what did you do next?\"\\n\\n     \"I reckon you\\'ll be shocked,\" replied Greywood Usher,\\n\"as I know you don\\'t cotton to the march of science in these matters.\\nI am given a good deal of discretion here, and perhaps take a little more\\nthan I\\'m given; and I thought it was an excellent opportunity to test\\nthat Psychometric Machine I told you about.  Now, in my opinion,\\nthat machine can\\'t lie.\"\\n\\n     \"No machine can lie,\" said Father Brown; \"nor can it tell the truth.\"\\n\\n     \"It did in this case, as I\\'ll show you,\" went on Usher positively.\\n\"I sat the man in the ill-fitting clothes in a comfortable chair,\\nand simply wrote words on a blackboard; and the machine simply\\nrecorded the variations of his pulse; and I simply observed his manner.\\nThe trick is to introduce some word connected with the supposed crime\\nin a list of words connected with something quite different,\\nyet a list in which it occurs quite naturally.  Thus I wrote `heron\\' and\\n`eagle\\' and `owl\\', and when I wrote `falcon\\' he was tremendously agitated;\\nand when I began to make an `r\\' at the end of the word,\\nthat machine just bounded.  Who else in this republic has any reason\\nto jump at the name of a newly-arrived Englishman like Falconroy\\nexcept the man who\\'s shot him?  Isn\\'t that better evidence than\\na lot of gabble  from  witnesses--if the evidence of a reliable machine?\"\\n\\n     \"You always forget,\" observed his companion, \"that the reliable machine\\nalways has to be worked by an unreliable machine.\"\\n\\n     \"Why, what do you mean?\" asked the detective.\\n\\n     \"I mean Man,\" said Father Brown, \"the most unreliable machine\\nI know of.  I don\\'t want to be rude; and I don\\'t think you will consider\\nMan to be an offensive or inaccurate description of yourself.\\nYou say you observed his manner; but how do you know you observed it right?\\nYou say the words have to come in a natural way; but how do you know\\nthat you did it naturally?  How do you know, if you come to that,\\nthat he did not observe your manner?  Who is to prove that you were not\\ntremendously agitated?  There was no machine tied on to your pulse.\"\\n\\n     \"I tell you,\" cried the American in the utmost excitement,\\n\"I was as cool as a cucumber.\"\\n\\n     \"Criminals also can be as cool as cucumbers,\" said Brown\\nwith a smile.  \"And almost as cool as you.\"\\n\\n     \"Well, this one wasn\\'t,\" said Usher, throwing the papers about.\\n\"Oh, you make me tired!\"\\n\\n     \"I\\'m sorry,\" said the other.  \"I only point out what seems\\na reasonable possibility.  If you could tell by his manner when\\nthe word that might hang him had come, why shouldn\\'t he tell\\nfrom your manner that the word that might hang him was coming?\\nI should ask for more than words myself before I hanged anybody.\"\\n\\n     Usher smote the table and rose in a sort of angry triumph.\\n\\n     \"And that,\" he cried, \"is just what I\\'m going to give you.\\nI tried the machine first just in order to test the thing in other ways\\nafterwards and the machine, sir, is right.\"\\n\\n     He paused a moment and resumed with less excitement.\\n\"I rather want to insist, if it comes to that, that so far\\nI had very little to go on except the scientific experiment.\\nThere was really nothing against the man at all.  His clothes were\\nill-fitting, as I\\'ve said, but they were rather better, if anything,\\nthan those of the submerged class to which he evidently belonged.\\nMoreover, under all the stains of his plunging through ploughed fields\\nor bursting through dusty hedges, the man was comparatively clean.\\nThis might mean, of course, that he had only just broken prison;\\nbut it reminded me more of the desperate decency of the comparatively\\nrespectable poor.  His demeanour was, I am bound to confess,\\nquite in accordance with theirs.  He was silent and dignified as they are;\\nhe seemed to have a big, but buried, grievance, as they do.\\nHe professed total ignorance of the crime and the whole question;\\nand showed nothing but a sullen impatience for something sensible\\nthat might come to take him out of his meaningless scrape.\\nHe asked me more than once if he could telephone for a lawyer\\nwho had helped him a long time ago in a trade dispute, and in every sense\\nacted as you would expect an innocent man to act.  There was nothing\\nagainst him in the world except that little finger on the dial\\nthat pointed to the change of his pulse.\\n\\n     \"Then, sir, the machine was on its trial; and the machine was right.\\nBy the time I came with him out of the private room into the vestibule\\nwhere all sorts of other people were awaiting examination,\\nI think he had already more or less made up his mind to clear things up\\nby something like a confession.  He turned to me and began to say\\nin a low voice:  `Oh, I can\\'t stick this any more.  If you must know\\nall about me--\\'\\n\\n     \"At the same instant one of the poor women sitting on the long bench\\nstood up, screaming aloud and pointing at him with her finger.\\nI have never in my life heard anything more demoniacally distinct.\\nHer lean finger seemed to pick him out as if it were a pea-shooter.\\nThough the word was a mere howl, every syllable was as clear\\nas a separate stroke on the clock.\\n\\n     \"`Drugger Davis!\\' she shouted.  `They\\'ve got Drugger Davis!\\'\\n\\n     \"Among the wretched women, mostly thieves and streetwalkers,\\ntwenty faces were turned, gaping with glee and hate.  If I had never\\nheard the words, I should have known by the very shock upon his features\\nthat the so-called Oscar Rian had heard his real name.  But I\\'m not quite\\nso ignorant, you may be surprised to hear.  Drugger Davis was\\none of the most terrible and depraved criminals that ever\\nbaffled our police.  It is certain he had done murder more than once\\nlong before his last exploit with the warder.  But he was never entirely\\nfixed for it, curiously enough because he did it in the same manner\\nas those milder--or meaner--crimes for which he was fixed pretty often.\\nHe was a handsome, well-bred-looking brute, as he still is, to some extent;\\nand he used mostly to go about with barmaids or shop-girls and do them\\nout of their money.  Very often, though, he went a good deal farther;\\nand they were found drugged with cigarettes or chocolates and\\ntheir whole property missing.  Then came one case where the girl\\nwas found dead; but deliberation could not quite be proved, and,\\nwhat was more practical still, the criminal could not be found.\\nI heard a rumour of his having reappeared somewhere in the opposite\\ncharacter this time, lending money instead of borrowing it;\\nbut still to such poor widows as he might personally fascinate,\\nbut still with the same bad result for them.  Well, there is\\nyour innocent man, and there is his innocent record.  Even, since then,\\nfour criminals and three warders have identified him and confirmed the story.\\nNow what have you got to say to my poor little machine after that?\\nHasn\\'t the machine done for him?  Or do you prefer to say that the woman\\nand I have done for him?\"\\n\\n     \"As to what you\\'ve done for him,\" replied Father Brown,\\nrising and shaking himself in a floppy way, \"you\\'ve saved him from\\nthe electrical chair.  I don\\'t think they can kill Drugger Davis\\non that old vague story of the poison; and as for the convict\\nwho killed the warder, I suppose it\\'s obvious that you haven\\'t got him.\\nMr Davis is innocent of that crime, at any rate.\"\\n\\n     \"What do you mean?\" demanded the other.  \"Why should he be\\ninnocent of that crime?\"\\n\\n     \"Why, bless us all!\" cried the small man in one of his rare\\nmoments of animation, \"why, because he\\'s guilty of the other crimes!\\nI don\\'t know what you people are made of.  You seem to think that\\nall sins are kept together in a bag.  You talk as if a miser on Monday\\nwere always a spendthrift on Tuesday.  You tell me this man you have here\\nspent weeks and months wheedling needy women out of small sums of money;\\nthat he used a drug at the best, and a poison at the worst;\\nthat he turned up afterwards as the lowest kind of moneylender,\\nand cheated most poor people in the same patient and pacific style.\\nLet it be granted--let us admit, for the sake of argument,\\nthat he did all this.  If that is so, I will tell you what he didn\\'t do.\\nHe didn\\'t storm a spiked wall against a man with a loaded gun.\\nHe didn\\'t write on the wall with his own hand, to say he had done it.\\nHe didn\\'t stop to state that his justification was self-defence.\\nHe didn\\'t explain that he had no quarrel with the poor warder.\\nHe didn\\'t name the house of the rich man to which he was going with the gun.\\nHe didn\\'t write his own, initials in a man\\'s blood.  Saints alive!\\nCan\\'t you see the whole character is different, in good and evil?\\nWhy, you don\\'t seem to be like I am a bit.  One would think\\nyou\\'d never had any vices of your own.\"\\n\\n     The amazed American had already parted his lips in protest\\nwhen the door of his private and official room was hammered\\nand rattled in an unceremonious way to which he was totally unaccustomed.\\n\\n     The door flew open.  The moment before Greywood Usher had been\\ncoming to the conclusion that Father Brown might possibly be mad.\\nThe moment after he began to think he was mad himself.\\nThere burst and fell into his private room a man in the filthiest rags,\\nwith a greasy squash hat still askew on his head, and a shabby green shade\\nshoved up from one of his eyes, both of which were glaring like a tiger\\'s.\\nThe rest of his face was almost undiscoverable, being masked with\\na matted beard and whiskers through which the nose could barely\\nthrust itself, and further buried in a squalid red scarf or handkerchief.\\nMr Usher prided himself on having seen most of the roughest specimens\\nin the State, but he thought he had never seen such a baboon dressed\\nas a scarecrow as this.  But, above all, he had never in all his\\nplacid scientific existence heard a man like that speak to him first.\\n\\n     \"See here, old man Usher,\" shouted the being in the red handkerchief,\\n\"I\\'m getting tired.  Don\\'t you try any of your hide-and-seek on me;\\nI don\\'t get fooled any.  Leave go of my guests, and I\\'ll let up\\non the fancy clockwork.  Keep him here for a split instant and you\\'ll\\nfeel pretty mean.  I reckon I\\'m not a man with no pull.\"\\n\\n     The eminent Usher was regarding the bellowing monster\\nwith an amazement which had dried up all other sentiments.\\nThe mere shock to his eyes had rendered his ears, almost useless.\\nAt last he rang a bell with a hand of violence.  While the bell was\\nstill strong and pealing, the voice of Father Brown fell soft but distinct.\\n\\n     \"I have a suggestion to make,\" he said, \"but it seems\\na little confusing.  I don\\'t know this gentleman--but--\\nbut I think I know him.  Now, you know him--you know him quite well--\\nbut you don\\'t know him--naturally.  Sounds paradoxical, I know.\"\\n\\n     \"I reckon the Cosmos is cracked,\" said Usher, and fell asprawl\\nin his round office chair.\\n\\n     \"Now, see here,\" vociferated the stranger, striking the table,\\nbut speaking in a voice that was all the more mysterious\\nbecause it was comparatively mild and rational though still resounding.\\n\"I won\\'t let you in.  I want--\"\\n\\n     \"Who in hell are you?\" yelled Usher, suddenly sitting up straight.\\n\\n     \"I think the gentleman\\'s name is Todd,\" said the priest.\\n\\n     Then he picked up the pink slip of newspaper.\\n\\n     \"I fear you don\\'t read the Society papers properly,\" he said,\\nand began to read out in a monotonous voice, \"`Or locked in\\nthe jewelled bosoms of our city\\'s gayest leaders; but there is talk\\nof a pretty parody of the manners and customs of the other end\\nof Society\\'s scale.\\' There\\'s been a big Slum Dinner up at\\nPilgrim\\'s Pond tonight; and a man, one of the guests, disappeared.\\nMr Ireton Todd is a good host, and has tracked him here,\\nwithout even waiting to take off his fancy-dress.\"\\n\\n     \"What man do you mean?\"\\n\\n     \"I mean the man with comically ill-fitting clothes you saw\\nrunning across the ploughed field.  Hadn\\'t you better go and\\ninvestigate him?  He will be rather impatient to get back to his champagne,\\nfrom which he ran away in such a hurry, when the convict with the gun\\nhove in sight.\"\\n\\n     \"Do you seriously mean--\" began the official.\\n\\n     \"Why, look here, Mr Usher,\" said Father Brown quietly,\\n\"you said the machine couldn\\'t make a mistake; and in one sense it didn\\'t.\\nBut the other machine did; the machine that worked it.\\nYou assumed that the man in rags jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy,\\nbecause he was Lord Falconroy\\'s murderer.  He jumped at the name\\nof Lord Falconroy because he is Lord Falconroy.\"\\n\\n     \"Then why the blazes didn\\'t he say so?\" demanded the staring Usher.\\n\\n     \"He felt his plight and recent panic were hardly patrician,\"\\nreplied the priest, \"so he tried to keep the name back at first.\\nBut he was just going to tell it you, when\"--and Father Brown looked\\ndown at his boots--\"when a woman found another name for him.\"\\n\\n     \"But you can\\'t be so mad as to say,\" said Greywood Usher,\\nvery white, \"that Lord Falconroy was Drugger Davis.\"\\n\\n     The priest looked at him very earnestly, but with a baffling\\nand undecipherable face.\\n\\n     \"I am not saying anything about it,\" he said.  \"I leave\\nall the rest to you.  Your pink paper says that the title\\nwas recently revived for him; but those papers are very unreliable.\\nIt says he was in the States in youth; but the whole story seems\\nvery strange.  Davis and Falconroy are both pretty considerable cowards,\\nbut so are lots of other men.  I would not hang a dog on my own opinion\\nabout this.  But I think,\" he went on softly and reflectively,\\n\"I think you Americans are too modest.  I think you idealize\\nthe English aristocracy--even in assuming it to be so aristocratic.\\nYou see a good-looking Englishman in evening-dress; you know\\nhe\\'s in the House of Lords; and you fancy he has a father.\\nYou don\\'t allow for our national buoyancy and uplift.  Many of our\\nmost influential noblemen have not only risen recently, but--\"\\n\\n     \"Oh, stop it!\" cried Greywood Usher, wringing one lean hand\\nin impatience against a shade of irony in the other\\'s face.\\n\\n     \"Don\\'t stay talking to this lunatic!\" cried Todd brutally.\\n\"Take me to my friend.\"\\n\\n     Next morning Father Brown appeared with the same demure expression,\\ncarrying yet another piece of pink newspaper.\\n\\n     \"I\\'m afraid you neglect the fashionable press rather,\" he said,\\n\"but this cutting may interest you.\"\\n\\n     Usher read the headlines, \"Last-Trick\\'s Strayed Revellers:\\nMirthful Incident near Pilgrim\\'s Pond.\" The paragraph went on:\\n\"A laughable occurrence took place outside Wilkinson\\'s Motor Garage\\nlast night.  A policeman on duty had his attention drawn by larrikins\\nto a man in prison dress who was stepping with considerable coolness\\ninto the steering-seat of a pretty high-toned Panhard; he was accompanied\\nby a girl wrapped in a ragged shawl.  On the police interfering,\\nthe young woman threw back the shawl, and all recognized\\nMillionaire Todd\\'s daughter, who had just come from the Slum Freak Dinner\\nat the Pond, where all the choicest guests were in a similar deshabille.\\nShe and the gentleman who had donned prison uniform were going for\\nthe customary joy-ride.\"\\n\\n     Under the pink slip Mr Usher found a strip of a later paper,\\nheaded, \"Astounding Escape of Millionaire\\'s Daughter with Convict.\\nShe had Arranged Freak Dinner.  Now Safe in--\"\\n\\n     Mr Greenwood Usher lifted his eyes, but Father Brown was gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. The Head of Caesar\\n\\n\\nTHERE is somewhere in Brompton or Kensington an interminable avenue\\nof tall houses, rich but largely empty, that looks like a terrace of tombs.\\nThe very steps up to the dark front doors seem as steep as\\nthe side of pyramids; one would hesitate to knock at the door,\\nlest it should be opened by a mummy.  But a yet more depressing feature\\nin the grey facade is its telescopic length and changeless continuity.\\nThe pilgrim walking down it begins to think he will never come to\\na break or a corner; but there is one exception--a very small one,\\nbut hailed by the pilgrim almost with a shout.  There is a sort of mews\\nbetween two of the tall mansions, a mere slit like the crack of a door\\nby comparison with the street, but just large enough to permit\\na pigmy ale-house or eating-house, still allowed by the rich to their\\nstable-servants, to stand in the angle.  There is something cheery in its\\nvery dinginess, and something free and elfin in its very insignificance.\\nAt the feet of those grey stone giants it looks like a lighted house\\nof dwarfs.\\n\\n     Anyone passing the place during a certain autumn evening,\\nitself almost fairylike, might have seen a hand pull aside\\nthe red half-blind which (along with some large white lettering)\\nhalf hid the interior from the street, and a face peer out not unlike\\na rather innocent goblin\\'s.  It was, in fact, the face of one with\\nthe harmless human name of Brown, formerly priest of Cobhole in Essex,\\nand now working in London.  His friend, Flambeau, a semi-official\\ninvestigator, was sitting opposite him, making his last notes of a case\\nhe had cleared up in the neighbourhood.  They were sitting at a small table,\\nclose up to the window, when the priest pulled the curtain back\\nand looked out.  He waited till a stranger in the street had\\npassed the window, to let the curtain fall into its place again.\\nThen his round eyes rolled to the large white lettering on the window\\nabove his head, and then strayed to the next table, at which sat only\\na navvy with beer and cheese, and a young girl with red hair and\\na glass of milk.  Then (seeing his friend put away the pocket-book),\\nhe said softly:\\n\\n     \"If you\\'ve got ten minutes, I wish you\\'d follow that man with\\nthe false nose.\"\\n\\n     Flambeau looked up in surprise; but the girl with the red hair\\nalso looked up, and with something that was stronger than astonishment.\\nShe was simply and even loosely dressed in light brown sacking stuff;\\nbut she was a lady, and even, on a second glance, a rather needlessly\\nhaughty one.  \"The man with the false nose!\" repeated Flambeau.\\n\"Who\\'s he?\"\\n\\n     \"I haven\\'t a notion,\" answered Father Brown.  \"I want you\\nto find out; I ask it as a favour.  He went down there\"--and he jerked\\nhis thumb over his shoulder in one of his undistinguished gestures--\\n\"and can\\'t have passed three lamp-posts yet.  I only want to know\\nthe direction.\"\\n\\n     Flambeau gazed at his friend for some time, with an expression\\nbetween perplexity and amusement; and then, rising from the table;\\nsqueezed his huge form out of the little door of the dwarf tavern,\\nand melted into the twilight.\\n\\n     Father Brown took a small book out of his pocket and began\\nto read steadily; he betrayed no consciousness of the fact that\\nthe red-haired lady had left her own table and sat down opposite him.\\nAt last she leaned over and said in a low, strong voice:\\n\"Why do you say that?  How do you know it\\'s false?\"\\n\\n     He lifted his rather heavy eyelids, which fluttered in\\nconsiderable embarrassment.  Then his dubious eye roamed again to\\nthe white lettering on the glass front of the public-house.\\nThe young woman\\'s eyes followed his, and rested there also,\\nbut in pure puzzledom.\\n\\n     \"No,\" said Father Brown, answering her thoughts.  \"It doesn\\'t say\\n`Sela\\', like the thing in the Psalms; I read it like that myself when\\nI was wool-gathering just now; it says `Ales.\\'\"\\n\\n     \"Well?\" inquired the staring young lady.  \"What does it matter\\nwhat it says?\"\\n\\n     His ruminating eye roved to the girl\\'s light canvas sleeve,\\nround the wrist of which ran a very slight thread of artistic pattern,\\njust enough to distinguish it from a working-dress of a common woman\\nand make it more like the working-dress of a lady art-student.\\nHe seemed to find much food for thought in this; but his reply was\\nvery slow and hesitant.  \"You see, madam,\" he said, \"from outside\\nthe place looks--well, it is a perfectly decent place--but ladies\\nlike you don\\'t--don\\'t generally think so.  They never go into such places\\nfrom choice, except--\"\\n\\n     \"Well?\" she repeated.\\n\\n     \"Except an unfortunate few who don\\'t go in to drink milk.\"\\n\\n     \"You are a most singular person,\" said the young lady.\\n\"What is your object in all this?\"\\n\\n     \"Not to trouble you about it,\" he replied, very gently.\\n\"Only to arm myself with knowledge enough to help you, if ever\\nyou freely ask my help.\"\\n\\n     \"But why should I need help?\"\\n\\n     He continued his dreamy monologue.  \"You couldn\\'t have come in\\nto see protegees, humble friends, that sort of thing, or you\\'d have\\ngone through into the parlour...and you couldn\\'t have come in because\\nyou were ill, or you\\'d have spoken to the woman of the place,\\nwho\\'s obviously respectable...besides, you don\\'t look ill in that way,\\nbut only unhappy....  This street is the only original long lane\\nthat has no turning; and the houses on both sides are shut up....\\nI could only suppose that you\\'d seen somebody coming whom you didn\\'t want\\nto meet; and found the public-house was the only shelter in this\\nwilderness of stone....  I don\\'t think I went beyond the licence of\\na stranger in glancing at the only man who passed immediately after....\\nAnd as I thought he looked like the wrong sort...and you looked like\\nthe right sort....  I held myself ready to help if he annoyed you;\\nthat is all.  As for my friend, he\\'ll be back soon; and he certainly\\ncan\\'t find out anything by stumping down a road like this....\\nI didn\\'t think he could.\"\\n\\n     \"Then why did you send him out?\" she cried, leaning forward with\\nyet warmer curiosity.  She had the proud, impetuous face that goes\\nwith reddish colouring, and a Roman nose, as it did in Marie Antoinette.\\n\\n     He looked at her steadily for the first time, and said:\\n\"Because I hoped you would speak to me.\"\\n\\n     She looked back at him for some time with a heated face,\\nin which there hung a red shadow of anger; then, despite her anxieties,\\nhumour broke out of her eyes and the corners of her mouth,\\nand she answered almost grimly:  \"Well, if you\\'re so keen on\\nmy conversation, perhaps you\\'ll answer my question.\"  After a pause\\nshe added:  \"I had the honour to ask you why you thought the man\\'s nose\\nwas false.\"\\n\\n     \"The wax always spots like that just a little in this weather,\"\\nanswered Father Brown with entire simplicity,\\n\\n     \"But it\\'s such a crooked nose,\" remonstrated the red-haired girl.\\n\\n     The priest smiled in his turn.  \"I don\\'t say it\\'s the sort of nose\\none would wear out of mere foppery,\" he admitted.  \"This man, I think,\\nwears it because his real nose is so much nicer.\"\\n\\n     \"But why?\" she insisted.\\n\\n     \"What is the nursery-rhyme?\" observed Brown absent-mindedly.\\n\"There was a crooked man and he went a crooked mile....  That man,\\nI fancy, has gone a very crooked road--by following his nose.\"\\n\\n     \"Why, what\\'s he done?\" she demanded, rather shakily.\\n\\n     \"I don\\'t want to force your confidence by a hair,\" said Father Brown,\\nvery quietly.  \"But I think you could tell me more about that than\\nI can tell you.\"\\n\\n     The girl sprang to her feet and stood quite quietly, but with\\nclenched hands, like one about to stride away; then her hands\\nloosened slowly, and she sat down again.  \"You are more of a mystery\\nthan all the others,\" she said desperately, \"but I feel there might be\\na heart in your mystery.\"\\n\\n     \"What we all dread most,\" said the priest in a low voice,\\n\"is a maze with no centre.  That is why atheism is only a nightmare.\"\\n\"I will tell you everything,\" said the red-haired girl doggedly,\\n\"except why I am telling you; and that I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n     She picked at the darned table-cloth and went on:  \"You look as if\\nyou knew what isn\\'t snobbery as well as what is; and when I say that\\nours is a good old family, you\\'ll understand it is a necessary part of\\nthe story; indeed, my chief danger is in my brother\\'s high-and-dry notions,\\nnoblesse oblige and all that.  Well, my name is Christabel Carstairs;\\nand my father was that Colonel Carstairs you\\'ve probably heard of,\\nwho made the famous Carstairs Collection of Roman coins.\\nI could never describe my father to you; the nearest I can say is\\nthat he was very like a Roman coin himself.  He was as handsome and\\nas genuine and as valuable and as metallic and as out-of-date.\\nHe was prouder of his Collection than of his coat-of-arms--\\nnobody could say more than that.  His extraordinary character\\ncame out most in his will.  He had two sons and one daughter.\\nHe quarrelled with one son, my brother Giles, and sent him\\nto Australia on a small allowance.  He then made a will leaving\\nthe Carstairs Collection, actually with a yet smaller allowance,\\nto my brother Arthur.  He meant it as a reward, as the highest honour\\nhe could offer, in acknowledgement of Arthur\\'s loyalty and rectitude\\nand the distinctions he had already gained in mathematics and economics\\nat Cambridge.  He left me practically all his pretty large fortune;\\nand I am sure he meant it in contempt.\\n\\n     \"Arthur, you may say, might well complain of this; but Arthur\\nis my father over again.  Though he had some differences with my\\nfather in early youth, no sooner had he taken over the Collection\\nthan he became like a pagan priest dedicated to a temple.\\nHe mixed up these Roman halfpence with the honour of the Carstairs\\nfamily in the same stiff, idolatrous way as his father before him.\\nHe acted as if Roman money must be guarded by all the Roman virtues.\\nHe took no pleasures; he spent nothing on himself; he lived for\\nthe Collection.  Often he would not trouble to dress for his simple meals;\\nbut pattered about among the corded brown-paper parcels (which no one else\\nwas allowed to touch) in an old brown dressing-gown.  With its rope\\nand tassel and his pale, thin, refined face, it made him look like\\nan old ascetic monk.  Every now and then, though, he would appear\\ndressed like a decidedly fashionable gentleman; but that was only when\\nhe went up to the London sales or shops to make an addition to\\nthe Carstairs Collection.\\n\\n     \"Now, if you\\'ve known any young people, you won\\'t be shocked\\nif I say that I got into rather a low frame of mind with all this;\\nthe frame of mind in which one begins to say that the Ancient Romans\\nwere all very well in their way.  I\\'m not like my brother Arthur;\\nI can\\'t help enjoying enjoyment.  I got a lot of romance and rubbish\\nwhere I got my red hair, from the other side of the family.\\nPoor Giles was the same; and I think the atmosphere of coins\\nmight count in excuse for him; though he really did wrong and nearly\\nwent to prison.  But he didn\\'t behave any worse than I did;\\nas you shall hear.\\n\\n     \"I come now to the silly part of the story.  I think a man\\nas clever as you can guess the sort of thing that would begin\\nto relieve the monotony for an unruly girl of seventeen placed in such\\na position.  But I am so rattled with more dreadful things that I can\\nhardly read my own feeling; and don\\'t know whether I despise it now\\nas a flirtation or bear it as a broken heart.  We lived then at\\na little seaside watering-place in South Wales, and a retired sea-captain\\nliving a few doors off had a son about five years older than myself,\\nwho had been a friend of Giles before he went to the Colonies.\\nHis name does not affect my tale; but I tell you it was Philip Hawker,\\nbecause I am telling you everything.  We used to go shrimping together,\\nand said and thought we were in love with each other; at least\\nhe certainly said he was, and I certainly thought I was.\\nIf I tell you he had bronzed curly hair and a falconish sort of face,\\nbronzed by the sea also, it\\'s not for his sake, I assure you,\\nbut for the story; for it was the cause of a very curious coincidence.\\n\\n     \"One summer afternoon, when I had promised to go shrimping\\nalong the sands with Philip, I was waiting rather impatiently\\nin the front drawing-room, watching Arthur handle some packets of coins\\nhe had just purchased and slowly shunt them, one or two at a time,\\ninto his own dark study and museum which was at the back of the house.\\nAs soon as I heard the heavy door close on him finally, I made a bolt\\nfor my shrimping-net and tam-o\\'-shanter and was just going to slip out,\\nwhen I saw that my brother had left behind him one coin that lay\\ngleaming on the long bench by the window.  It was a bronze coin,\\nand the colour, combined with the exact curve of the Roman nose\\nand something in the very lift of the long, wiry neck, made the head\\nof Caesar on it the almost precise portrait of Philip Hawker.\\nThen I suddenly remembered Giles telling Philip of a coin that was\\nlike him, and Philip wishing he had it.  Perhaps you can fancy the wild,\\nfoolish thoughts with which my head went round; I felt as if I had\\nhad a gift from the fairies.  It seemed to me that if I could only\\nrun away with this, and give it to Philip like a wild sort of wedding-ring,\\nit would be a bond between us for ever; I felt a thousand such things\\nat once.  Then there yawned under me, like the pit, the enormous,\\nawful notion of what I was doing; above all, the unbearable thought,\\nwhich was like touching hot iron, of what Arthur would think of it.\\nA Carstairs a thief; and a thief of the Carstairs treasure!\\nI believe my brother could see me burned like a witch for such a thing,\\nBut then, the very thought of such fanatical cruelty heightened\\nmy old hatred of his dingy old antiquarian fussiness and my longing\\nfor the youth and liberty that called to me from the sea.\\nOutside was strong sunlight with a wind; and a yellow head of some\\nbroom or gorse in the garden rapped against the glass of the window.\\nI thought of that living and growing gold calling to me from all\\nthe heaths of the world--and then of that dead, dull gold and bronze\\nand brass of my brother\\'s growing dustier and dustier as life went by.\\nNature and the Carstairs Collection had come to grips at last.\\n\\n     \"Nature is older than the Carstairs Collection.  As I ran\\ndown the streets to the sea, the coin clenched tight in my fist,\\nI felt all the Roman Empire on my back as well as the Carstairs pedigree.\\nIt was not only the old lion argent that was roaring in my ear,\\nbut all the eagles of the Caesars seemed flapping and screaming\\nin pursuit of me.  And yet my heart rose higher and higher like\\na child\\'s kite, until I came over the loose, dry sand-hills and to\\nthe flat, wet sands, where Philip stood already up to his ankles\\nin the shallow shining water, some hundred yards out to sea.\\nThere was a great red sunset; and the long stretch of low water,\\nhardly rising over the ankle for half a mile, was like a lake\\nof ruby flame.  It was not till I had torn off my shoes and stockings\\nand waded to where he stood, which was well away from the dry land,\\nthat I turned and looked round.  We were quite alone in a circle\\nof sea-water and wet sand, and I gave him the head of Caesar.\\n\\n     \"At the very instant I had a shock of fancy:  that a man far away\\non the sand-hills was looking at me intently.  I must have felt\\nimmediately after that it was a mere leap of unreasonable nerves;\\nfor the man was only a dark dot in the distance, and I could only just see\\nthat he was standing quite still and gazing, with his head a little\\non one side.  There was no earthly logical evidence that he was\\nlooking at me; he might have been looking at a ship, or the sunset,\\nor the sea-gulls, or at any of the people who still strayed here and there\\non the shore between us.  Nevertheless, whatever my start sprang from\\nwas prophetic; for, as I gazed, he started walking briskly in a bee-line\\ntowards us across the wide wet sands.  As he drew nearer and nearer\\nI saw that he was dark and bearded, and that his eyes were marked with\\ndark spectacles.  He was dressed poorly but respectably in black,\\nfrom the old black top hat on his head to the solid black boots\\non his feet.  In spite of these he walked straight into the sea\\nwithout a flash of hesitation, and came on at me with the steadiness\\nof a travelling bullet.\\n\\n     \"I can\\'t tell you the sense of monstrosity and miracle I had\\nwhen he thus silently burst the barrier between land and water.\\nIt was as if he had walked straight off a cliff and still marched\\nsteadily in mid-air.  It was as if a house had flown up into the sky\\nor a man\\'s head had fallen off.  He was only wetting his boots;\\nbut he seemed to be a demon disregarding a law of Nature.  If he had\\nhesitated an instant at the water\\'s edge it would have been nothing.\\nAs it was, he seemed to look so much at me alone as not to notice the ocean.\\nPhilip was some yards away with his back to me, bending over his net.\\nThe stranger came on till he stood within two yards of me, the water\\nwashing half-way up to his knees.  Then he said, with a clearly modulated\\nand rather mincing articulation:  `Would it discommode you to contribute\\nelsewhere a coin with a somewhat different superscription?\\'\\n\\n     \"With one exception there was nothing definably abnormal about him.\\nHis tinted glasses were not really opaque, but of a blue kind common enough,\\nnor were the eyes behind them shifty, but regarded me steadily.\\nHis dark beard was not really long or wild--, but he looked rather hairy,\\nbecause the beard began very high up in his face, just under\\nthe cheek-bones.  His complexion was neither sallow nor livid,\\nbut on the contrary rather clear and youthful; yet this gave\\na pink-and-white wax look which somehow (I don\\'t know why) rather\\nincreased the horror.  The only oddity one could fix was that his nose,\\nwhich was otherwise of a good shape, was just slightly turned sideways\\nat the tip; as if, when it was soft, it had been tapped on one side\\nwith a toy hammer.  The thing was hardly a deformity; yet I cannot\\ntell you what a living nightmare it was to me.  As he stood there\\nin the sunset-stained water he affected me as some hellish sea-monster\\njust risen roaring out of a sea like blood.  I don\\'t know why\\na touch on the nose should affect my imagination so much.\\nI think it seemed as if he could move his nose like a finger.\\nAnd as if he had just that moment moved it.\\n\\n     \"`Any little assistance,\\' he continued with the same queer,\\npriggish accent, `that may obviate the necessity of my communicating\\nwith the family.\\'\\n\\n     \"Then it rushed over me that I was being blackmailed for\\nthe theft of the bronze piece; and all my merely superstitious fears\\nand doubts were swallowed up in one overpowering, practical question.\\nHow could he have found out?  I had stolen the thing suddenly and on impulse;\\nI was certainly alone; for I always made sure of being unobserved\\nwhen I slipped out to see Philip in this way.  I had not,\\nto all appearance, been followed in the street; and if I had,\\nthey could not `X-ray\\' the coin in my closed hand.  The man standing\\non the sand-hills could no more have seen what I gave Philip than\\nshoot a fly in one eye, like the man in the fairy-tale.\\n\\n     \"`Philip,\\' I cried helplessly, `ask this man what he wants.\\'\\n\\n     \"When Philip lifted his head at last from mending his net\\nhe looked rather red, as if sulky or ashamed; but it may have been\\nonly the exertion of stooping and the red evening light; I may have\\nonly had another of the morbid fancies that seemed to be dancing about me.\\nHe merely said gruffly to the man: `You clear out of this.\\'\\nAnd, motioning me to follow, set off wading shoreward without paying\\nfurther attention to him.  He stepped on to a stone breakwater that\\nran out from among the roots of the sand-hills, and so struck homeward,\\nperhaps thinking our incubus would find it less easy to walk on such\\nrough stones, green and slippery with seaweed, than we, who were young\\nand used to it.  But my persecutor walked as daintily as he talked;\\nand he still followed me, picking his way and picking his phrases.\\nI heard his delicate, detestable voice appealing to me over my shoulder,\\nuntil at last, when we had crested the sand-hills, Philip\\'s patience\\n(which was by no means so conspicuous on most occasions) seemed to snap.\\nHe turned suddenly, saying, `Go back.  I can\\'t talk to you now.\\'\\nAnd as the man hovered and opened his mouth, Philip struck him a buffet\\non it that sent him flying from the top of the tallest sand-hill\\nto the bottom.  I saw him crawling out below, covered with sand.\\n\\n     \"This stroke comforted me somehow, though it might well increase\\nmy peril; but Philip showed none of his usual elation at his own prowess.\\nThough as affectionate as ever, he still seemed cast down; and before\\nI could ask him anything fully, he parted with me at his own gate,\\nwith two remarks that struck me as strange.  He said that,\\nall things considered, I ought to put the coin back in the Collection;\\nbut that he himself would keep it `for the present\\'.  And then he added\\nquite suddenly and irrelevantly:, `You know Giles is back from Australia?\\'\"\\n\\n     The door of the tavern opened and the gigantic shadow of\\nthe investigator Flambeau fell across the table.  Father Brown\\npresented him to the lady in his own slight, persuasive style of speech,\\nmentioning his knowledge and sympathy in such cases; and almost\\nwithout knowing, the girl was soon reiterating her story to two listeners.\\nBut Flambeau, as he bowed and sat down, handed the priest a small slip\\nof paper.  Brown accepted it with some surprise and read on it:\\n\"Cab to Wagga Wagga, 379, Mafeking Avenue, Putney.\" The girl was going\\non with her story.\\n\\n     \"I went up the steep street to my own house with my head in a whirl;\\nit had not begun to clear when I came to the doorstep, on which\\nI found a milk-can--and the man with the twisted nose.  The milk-can\\ntold me the servants were all out; for, of course, Arthur,\\nbrowsing about in his brown dressing-gown in a brown study,\\nwould not hear or answer a bell.  Thus there was no one to help me\\nin the house, except my brother, whose help must be my ruin.\\nIn desperation I thrust two shillings into the horrid thing\\'s hand,\\nand told him to call again in a few days, when I had thought it out.\\nHe went off sulking, but more sheepishly than I had expected--\\nperhaps he had been shaken by his fall--and I watched the star of sand\\nsplashed on his back receding down the road with a horrid vindictive\\npleasure.  He turned a corner some six houses down.\\n\\n     \"Then I let myself in, made myself some tea, and tried to\\nthink it out.  I sat at the drawing-room window looking on to the garden,\\nwhich still glowed with the last full evening light.  But I was too\\ndistracted and dreamy to look at the lawns and flower-pots and flower-beds\\nwith any concentration.  So I took the shock the more sharply because\\nI\\'d seen it so slowly.\\n\\n     \"The man or monster I\\'d sent away was standing quite still\\nin the middle of the garden.  Oh, we\\'ve all read a lot about\\npale-faced phantoms in the dark; but this was more dreadful\\nthan anything of that kind could ever be.  Because, though he cast\\na long evening shadow, he still stood in warm sunlight.  And because\\nhis face was not pale, but had that waxen bloom still upon it\\nthat belongs to a barber\\'s dummy.  He stood quite still, with his face\\ntowards me; and I can\\'t tell you how horrid he looked among the tulips\\nand all those tall, gaudy, almost hothouse-looking flowers.\\nIt looked as if we\\'d stuck up a waxwork instead of a statue in\\nthe centre of our garden.\\n\\n     \"Yet almost the instant he saw me move in the window he turned\\nand ran out of the garden by the back gate, which stood open and\\nby which he had undoubtedly entered.  This renewed timidity on his part\\nwas so different from the impudence with which he had walked into the sea,\\nthat I felt vaguely comforted.  I fancied, perhaps, that he feared\\nconfronting Arthur more than I knew.  Anyhow, I settled down at last,\\nand had a quiet dinner alone (for it was against the rules to\\ndisturb Arthur when he was rearranging the museum), and, my thoughts,\\na little released, fled to Philip and lost themselves, I suppose.\\nAnyhow, I was looking blankly, but rather pleasantly than otherwise,\\nat another window, uncurtained, but by this time black as a slate\\nwith the final night-fall.  It seemed to me that something like a snail\\nwas on the outside of the window-pane.  But when I stared harder,\\nit was more like a man\\'s thumb pressed on the pane; it had that curled look\\nthat a thumb has.  With my fear and courage re-awakened together,\\nI rushed at the window and then recoiled with a strangled scream\\nthat any man but Arthur must have heard.\\n\\n     \"For it was not a thumb, any more than it was a snail.\\nIt was the tip of a crooked nose, crushed against the glass;\\nit looked white with the pressure; and the staring face and eyes\\nbehind it were at first invisible and afterwards grey like a ghost.\\nI slammed the shutters together somehow, rushed up to my room and\\nlocked myself in.  But, even as I passed, I could swear I saw\\na second black window with something on it that was like a snail.\\n\\n     \"It might be best to go to Arthur after all.  If the thing\\nwas crawling close all around the house like a cat, it might have\\npurposes worse even than blackmail.  My brother might cast me out\\nand curse me for ever, but he was a gentleman, and would defend me\\non the spot.  After ten minutes\\' curious thinking, I went down,\\nknocked on the door and then went in:  to see the last and worst sight.\\n\\n     \"My brother\\'s chair was empty, and he was obviously out.\\nBut the man with the crooked nose was sitting waiting for his return,\\nwith his hat still insolently on his head, and actually reading\\none of my brother\\'s books under my brother\\'s lamp.  His face was composed\\nand occupied, but his nose-tip still had the air of being the most mobile\\npart of his face, as if it had just turned from left to right like\\nan elephant\\'s proboscis.  I had thought him poisonous enough while\\nhe was pursuing and watching me; but I think his unconsciousness\\nof my presence was more frightful still.\\n\\n     \"I think I screamed loud and long; but that doesn\\'t matter.\\nWhat I did next does matter:  I gave him all the money I had,\\nincluding a good deal in paper which, though it was mine, I dare say\\nI had no right to touch.  He went off at last, with hateful,\\ntactful regrets all in long words; and I sat down, feeling ruined\\nin every sense.  And yet I was saved that very night by a pure accident.\\nArthur had gone off suddenly to London, as he so often did, for bargains;\\nand returned, late but radiant, having nearly secured a treasure\\nthat was an added splendour even to the family Collection.\\nHe was so resplendent that I was almost emboldened to confess\\nthe abstraction of the lesser gem--, but he bore down all other topics\\nwith his over-powering projects.  Because the bargain might still\\nmisfire any moment, he insisted on my packing at once and going up\\nwith him to lodgings he had already taken in Fulham, to be near\\nthe curio-shop in question.  Thus in spite of myself, I fled from my foe\\nalmost in the dead of night--but from Philip also....  My brother\\nwas often at the South Kensington Museum, and, in order to make\\nsome sort of secondary life for myself, I paid for a few lessons\\nat the Art Schools.  I was coming back from them this evening,\\nwhen I saw the abomination of desolation walking alive down\\nthe long straight street and the rest is as this gentleman has said.\\n\\n     \"I\\'ve got only one thing to say.  I don\\'t deserve to be helped;\\nand I don\\'t question or complain of my punishment; it is just,\\nit ought to have happened.  But I still question, with bursting brains,\\nhow it can have happened.  Am I punished by miracle? or how can anyone but\\nPhilip and myself know I gave him a tiny coin in the middle of the sea?\"\\n\\n     \"It is an extraordinary problem,\" admitted Flambeau.\\n\\n     \"Not so extraordinary as the answer,\" remarked Father Brown\\nrather gloomily.  \"Miss Carstairs, will you be at home if we call\\nat your Fulham place in an hour and a half hence?\"\\n\\n     The girl looked at him, and then rose and put her gloves on.\\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I\\'ll be there\"; and almost instantly left the place.\\n\\n     That night the detective and the priest were still talking\\nof the matter as they drew near the Fulham house, a tenement\\nstrangely mean even for a temporary residence of the Carstairs family.\\n\\n     \"Of course the superficial, on reflection,\" said Flambeau,\\n\"would think first of this Australian brother who\\'s been\\nin trouble before, who\\'s come back so suddenly and who\\'s just the man\\nto have shabby confederates.  But I can\\'t see how he can\\ncome into the thing by any process of thought, unless...\"\\n\\n     \"Well?\" asked his companion patiently.\\n\\n     Flambeau lowered his voice.  \"Unless the girl\\'s lover comes in,\\ntoo, and he would be the blacker villain.  The Australian chap\\ndid know that Hawker wanted the coin.  But I can\\'t see how on earth\\nhe could know that Hawker had got it, unless Hawker signalled to him\\nor his representative across the shore.\"\\n\\n     \"That is true,\" assented the priest, with respect.\\n\\n     \"Have you noted another thing?\" went on Flambeau eagerly.\\n\"this Hawker hears his love insulted, but doesn\\'t strike till he\\'s got\\nto the soft sand-hills, where he can be victor in a mere sham-fight.\\nIf he\\'d struck amid rocks and sea, he might have hurt his ally.\"\\n\\n     \"That is true again,\" said Father Brown, nodding.\\n\\n     \"And now, take it from the start.  It lies between few people,\\nbut at least three.  You want one person for suicide; two people\\nfor murder; but at least three people for blackmail\"\\n\\n     \"Why?\" asked the priest softly.\\n\\n     \"Well, obviously,\" cried his friend, \"there must be one to be exposed;\\none to threaten exposure; and one at least whom exposure would horrify.\"\\n\\n     After a long ruminant pause, the priest said:  \"You miss a logical step.\\nThree persons are needed as ideas.  Only two are needed as agents.\"\\n\\n     \"What can you mean?\" asked the other.\\n\\n     \"Why shouldn\\'t a blackmailer,\" asked Brown, in a low voice,\\n\"threaten his victim with himself?  Suppose a wife became\\na rigid teetotaller in order to frighten her husband into concealing\\nhis pub-frequenting, and then wrote him blackmailing letters\\nin another hand, threatening to tell his wife!  Why shouldn\\'t it work?\\nSuppose a father forbade a son to gamble and then, following him\\nin a good disguise, threatened the boy with his own sham\\npaternal strictness!  Suppose--but, here we are, my friend.\"\\n\\n     \"My God!\" cried Flambeau; \"you don\\'t mean--\"\\n\\n     An active figure ran down the steps of the house and showed\\nunder the golden lamplight the unmistakable head that resembled\\nthe Roman coin.  \"Miss Carstairs,\" said Hawker without ceremony,\\n\"wouldn\\'t go in till you came.\"\\n\\n     \"Well,\" observed Brown confidently, \"don\\'t you think it\\'s\\nthe best thing she can do to stop outside--with you to look after her?\\nYou see, I rather guess you have guessed it all yourself.\"\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" said the young man, in an undertone, \"I guessed\\non the sands and now I know; that was why I let him fall soft.\"\\n\\n     Taking a latchkey from the girl and the coin from Hawker,\\nFlambeau let himself and his friend into the empty house and passed\\ninto the outer parlour.  It was empty of all occupants but one.\\nThe man whom Father Brown had seen pass the tavern was standing\\nagainst the wall as if at bay; unchanged, save that he had taken off\\nhis black coat and was wearing a brown dressing-gown.\\n\\n     \"We have come,\" said Father Brown politely, \"to give back\\nthis coin to its owner.\"  And he handed it to the man with the nose.\\n\\n     Flambeau\\'s eyes rolled.  \"Is this man a coin-collector?\" he asked.\\n\\n     \"This man is Mr Arthur Carstairs,\" said the priest positively,\\n\"and he is a coin-collector of a somewhat singular kind.\"\\n\\n     The man changed colour so horribly that the crooked nose\\nstood out on his face like a separate and comic thing.  He spoke,\\nnevertheless, with a sort of despairing dignity.  \"You shall see,\\nthen,\" he said, \"that I have not lost all the family qualities.\"\\nAnd he turned suddenly and strode into an inner room, slamming the door.\\n\\n     \"Stop him!\" shouted Father Brown, bounding and half falling\\nover a chair; and, after a wrench or two, Flambeau had the door open.\\nBut it was too late.  In dead silence Flambeau strode across\\nand telephoned for doctor and police.\\n\\n     An empty medicine bottle lay on the floor.  Across the table\\nthe body of the man in the brown dressing-gown lay amid his burst\\nand gaping brown-paper parcels; out of which poured and rolled,\\nnot Roman, but very modern English coins.\\n\\n     The priest held up the bronze head of Caesar.  \"This,\" he said,\\n\"was all that was left of the Carstairs Collection.\"\\n\\n     After a silence he went on, with more than common gentleness:\\n\"It was a cruel will his wicked father made, and you see he did\\nresent it a little.  He hated the Roman money he had, and grew fonder\\nof the real money denied him.  He not only sold the Collection\\nbit by bit, but sank bit by bit to the basest ways of making money--\\neven to blackmailing his own family in a disguise.  He blackmailed\\nhis brother from Australia for his little forgotten crime (that is why\\nhe took the cab to Wagga Wagga in Putney), he blackmailed his sister\\nfor the theft he alone could have noticed.  And that, by the way,\\nis why she had that supernatural guess when he was away on the sand-dunes.\\nMere figure and gait, however distant, are more likely to remind us\\nof somebody than a well-made-up face quite close.\"\\n\\n     There was another silence.  \"Well,\" growled the detective,\\n\"and so this great numismatist and coin-collector was nothing but\\na vulgar miser.\"\\n\\n     \"Is there so great a difference?\" asked Father Brown, in the same\\nstrange, indulgent tone.  \"What is there wrong about a miser that is\\nnot often as wrong about a collector?  What is wrong, except...\\nthou shalt not make to thyself any graven image; thou shalt not\\nbow down to them nor serve them, for I...but we must go and see how\\nthe poor young people are getting on.\"\\n\\n     \"I think,\" said Flambeau, \"that in spite of everything,\\nthey are probably getting on very well.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. The Purple Wig\\n\\n\\nMR EDWARD NUTT, the industrious editor of the Daily Reformer,\\nsat at his desk, opening letters and marking proofs to the merry tune\\nof a typewriter, worked by a vigorous young lady.\\n\\n     He was a stoutish, fair man, in his shirt-sleeves; his movements\\nwere resolute, his mouth firm and his tones final; but his round,\\nrather babyish blue eyes had a bewildered and even wistful look\\nthat rather contradicted all this.  Nor indeed was the expression\\naltogether misleading.  It might truly be said of him, as for many\\njournalists in authority, that his most familiar emotion was one of\\ncontinuous fear; fear of libel actions, fear of lost advertisements,\\nfear of misprints, fear of the sack.\\n\\n     His life was a series of distracted compromises between\\nthe proprietor of the paper (and of him), who was a senile soap-boiler\\nwith three ineradicable mistakes in his mind, and the very able staff\\nhe had collected to run the paper; some of whom were brilliant\\nand experienced men and (what was even worse) sincere enthusiasts\\nfor the political policy of the paper.\\n\\n     A letter from one of these lay immediately before him,\\nand rapid and resolute as he was, he seemed almost to hesitate\\nbefore opening it.  He took up a strip of proof instead, ran down it\\nwith a blue eye, and a blue pencil, altered the word \"adultery\"\\nto the word \"impropriety,\" and the word \"Jew\" to the word \"Alien,\"\\nrang a bell and sent it flying upstairs.\\n\\n     Then, with a more thoughtful eye, he ripped open the letter from his\\nmore distinguished contributor, which bore a postmark of Devonshire,\\nand read as follows:\\n\\n     DEAR NUTT,--As I see you\\'re working Spooks and Dooks at the same time,\\nwhat about an article on that rum business of the Eyres of Exmoor;\\nor as the old women call it down here, the Devil\\'s Ear of Eyre?\\nThe head of the family, you know, is the Duke of Exmoor; he is one of\\nthe few really stiff old Tory aristocrats left, a sound old crusted tyrant\\nit is quite in our line to make trouble about.  And I think I\\'m\\non the track of a story that will make trouble.\\n\\n     Of course I don\\'t believe in the old legend about James I;\\nand as for you, you don\\'t believe in anything, not even in journalism.\\nThe legend, you\\'ll probably remember, was about the blackest business\\nin English history--the poisoning of Overbury by that witch\\'s cat\\nFrances Howard, and the quite mysterious terror which forced the King\\nto pardon the murderers.  There was a lot of alleged witchcraft\\nmixed up with it; and the story goes that a man-servant listening\\nat the keyhole heard the truth in a talk between the King and Carr;\\nand the bodily ear with which he heard grew large and monstrous\\nas by magic, so awful was the secret.  And though he had to be loaded\\nwith lands and gold and made an ancestor of dukes, the elf-shaped ear\\nis still recurrent in the family.  Well, you don\\'t believe in black magic;\\nand if you did, you couldn\\'t use it for copy.  If a miracle happened\\nin your office, you\\'d have to hush it up, now so many bishops\\nare agnostics.  But that is not the point The point is that\\nthere really is something queer about Exmoor and his family;\\nsomething quite natural, I dare say, but quite abnormal.\\nAnd the Ear is in it somehow, I fancy; either a symbol or a delusion\\nor disease or something.  Another tradition says that Cavaliers\\njust after James I began to wear their hair long only to cover\\nthe ear of the first Lord Exmoor.  This also is no doubt fanciful.\\n\\n     The reason I point it out to you is this:  It seems to me that\\nwe make a mistake in attacking aristocracy entirely for its champagne\\nand diamonds.  Most men rather admire the nobs for having a good time,\\nbut I think we surrender too much when we admit that aristocracy\\nhas made even the aristocrats happy.  I suggest a series of articles\\npointing out how dreary, how inhuman, how downright diabolist,\\nis the very smell and atmosphere of some of these great houses.\\nThere are plenty of instances; but you couldn\\'t begin with a better one\\nthan the Ear of the Eyres.  By the end of the week I think I can\\nget you the truth about it.--Yours ever, FRANCIS FINN.\\n\\n     Mr Nutt reflected a moment, staring at his left boot;\\nthen he called out in a strong, loud and entirely lifeless voice,\\nin which every syllable sounded alike:  \"Miss Barlow, take down\\na letter to Mr Finn, please.\"\\n\\n     DEAR FINN,--I think it would do; copy should reach us second post\\nSaturday.--Yours, E. NUTT.\\n\\n     This elaborate epistle he articulated as if it were all one word;\\nand Miss Barlow rattled it down as if it were all one word.\\nThen he took up another strip of proof and a blue pencil,\\nand altered the word \"supernatural\" to the word \"marvellous\",\\nand the expression \"shoot down\" to the expression \"repress\".\\n\\n     In such happy, healthful activities did Mr Nutt disport himself,\\nuntil the ensuing Saturday found him at the same desk, dictating to\\nthe same typist, and using the same blue pencil on the first instalment\\nof Mr Finn\\'s revelations.  The opening was a sound piece of slashing\\ninvective about the evil secrets of princes, and despair in the high places\\nof the earth.  Though written violently, it was in excellent English;\\nbut the editor, as usual, had given to somebody else the task\\nof breaking it up into sub-headings, which were of a spicier sort,\\nas \"Peeress and Poisons\", and \"The Eerie Ear\", \"The Eyres in their Eyrie\",\\nand so on through a hundred happy changes.  Then followed the legend\\nof the Ear, amplified from Finn\\'s first letter, and then the substance\\nof his later discoveries, as follows:\\n\\n\\n     I know it is the practice of journalists to put the end of the story\\nat the beginning and call it a headline.  I know that journalism\\nlargely consists in saying \"Lord Jones Dead\" to people who never knew\\nthat Lord Jones was alive.  Your present correspondent thinks that this,\\nlike many other journalistic customs, is bad journalism; and that\\nthe Daily Reformer has to set a better example in such things.\\nHe proposes to tell his story as it occurred, step by step.\\nHe will use the real names of the parties, who in most cases are ready\\nto confirm his testimony.   As for the headlines, the sensational\\nproclamations--they will come at the end.\\n\\n     I was walking along a public path that threads through\\na private Devonshire orchard and seems to point towards Devonshire cider,\\nwhen I came suddenly upon just such a place as the path suggested.\\nIt was a long, low inn, consisting really of a cottage and two barns;\\nthatched all over with the thatch that looks like brown and grey hair\\ngrown before history.  But outside the door was a sign which\\ncalled it the Blue Dragon; and under the sign was one of those long\\nrustic tables that used to stand outside most of the free English inns,\\nbefore teetotallers and brewers between them destroyed freedom.\\nAnd at this table sat three gentlemen, who might have lived\\na hundred years ago.\\n\\n     Now that I know them all better, there is no difficulty\\nabout disentangling the impressions; but just then they looked like\\nthree very solid ghosts.  The dominant figure, both because he was\\nbigger in all three dimensions, and because he sat centrally\\nin the length of the table, facing me, was a tall, fat man dressed\\ncompletely in black, with a rubicund, even apoplectic visage,\\nbut a rather bald and rather bothered brow.  Looking at him again,\\nmore strictly, I could not exactly say what it was that gave me\\nthe sense of antiquity, except the antique cut of his white\\nclerical necktie and the barred wrinkles across his brow.\\n\\n     It was even less easy to fix the impression in the case of\\nthe man at the right end of the table, who, to say truth,\\nwas as commonplace a person as could be seen anywhere, with a round,\\nbrown-haired head and a round snub nose, but also clad in clerical black,\\nof a stricter cut.  It was only when I saw his broad curved hat lying\\non the table beside him that I realized why I connected him with\\nanything ancient.  He was a Roman Catholic priest.\\n\\n     Perhaps the third man, at the other end of the table,\\nhad really more to do with it than the rest, though he was both\\nslighter in physical presence and more inconsiderate in his dress.\\nHis lank limbs were clad, I might also say clutched, in very tight\\ngrey sleeves and pantaloons; he had a long, sallow, aquiline face\\nwhich seemed somehow all the more saturnine because his lantern jaws\\nwere imprisoned in his collar and neck-cloth more in the style of\\nthe old stock; and his hair (which ought to have been dark brown)\\nwas of an odd dim, russet colour which, in conjunction with\\nhis yellow face, looked rather purple than red.  The unobtrusive\\nyet unusual colour was all the more notable because his hair was\\nalmost unnaturally healthy and curling, and he wore it full.\\nBut, after all analysis, I incline to think that what gave me\\nmy first old-fashioned impression was simply a set of tall,\\nold-fashioned wine-glasses, one or two lemons and two churchwarden pipes.\\nAnd also, perhaps, the old-world errand on which I had come.\\n\\n     Being a hardened reporter, and it being apparently a public inn,\\nI did not need to summon much of my impudence to sit down at\\nthe long table and order some cider.  The big man in black seemed\\nvery learned, especially about local antiquities; the small man in black,\\nthough he talked much less, surprised me with a yet wider culture.\\nSo we got on very well together; but the third man, the old gentleman\\nin the tight pantaloons, seemed rather distant and haughty,\\nuntil I slid into the subject of the Duke of Exmoor and his ancestry.\\n\\n     I thought the subject seemed to embarrass the other two a little;\\nbut it broke the spell of the third man\\'s silence most successfully.\\nSpeaking with restraint and with the accent of a highly educated gentleman,\\nand puffing at intervals at his long churchwarden pipe, he proceeded\\nto tell me some of the most horrible stories I have ever heard in my life:\\nhow one of the Eyres in the former ages had hanged his own father;\\nand another had his wife scourged at the cart tail through the village;\\nand another had set fire to a church full of children, and so on.\\n\\n     Some of the tales, indeed, are not fit for public print--,\\nsuch as the story of the Scarlet Nuns, the abominable story of\\nthe Spotted Dog, or the thing that was done in the quarry.\\nAnd all this red roll of impieties came from his thin, genteel lips\\nrather primly than otherwise, as he sat sipping the wine out of\\nhis tall, thin glass.\\n\\n     I could see that the big man opposite me was trying,\\nif anything, to stop him; but he evidently held the old gentleman\\nin considerable respect, and could not venture to do so at all abruptly.\\nAnd the little priest at the other end of the-table, though free from\\nany such air of embarrassment, looked steadily at the table,\\nand seemed to listen to the recital with great pain--as well as he might.\\n\\n     \"You don\\'t seem,\" I said to the narrator, \"to be very fond of\\nthe Exmoor pedigree.\"\\n\\n     He looked at me a moment, his lips still prim, but whitening\\nand tightening; then he deliberately broke his long pipe and glass\\non the table and stood up, the very picture of a perfect gentleman\\nwith the framing temper of a fiend.\\n\\n     \"These gentlemen,\" he said, \"will tell you whether I have cause\\nto like it.  The curse of the Eyres of old has lain heavy on this country,\\nand many have suffered from it.  They know there are none who have\\nsuffered from it as I have.\"  And with that he crushed a piece of\\nthe fallen glass under his heel, and strode away among the green twilight\\nof the twinkling apple-trees.\\n\\n     \"That is an extraordinary old gentleman,\" I said to the other two;\\n\"do you happen to know what the Exmoor family has done to him?  Who is he?\"\\n\\n     The big man in black was staring at me with the wild air of\\na baffled bull; he did not at first seem to take it in.  Then he said\\nat last, \"Don\\'t you know who he is?\"\\n\\n     I reaffirmed my ignorance, and there was another silence;\\nthen the little priest said, still looking at the table, \"That is\\nthe Duke of Exmoor.\"\\n\\n     Then, before I could collect my scattered senses, he added\\nequally quietly, but with an air of regularizing things:\\n\"My friend here is Doctor Mull, the Duke\\'s librarian.  My name is Brown.\"\\n\\n     \"But,\" I stammered, \"if that is the Duke, why does he damn all\\nthe old dukes like that?\"\\n\\n     \"He seems really to believe,\" answered the priest called Brown,\\n\"that they have left a curse on him.\" Then he added, with some irrelevance,\\n\"That\\'s why he wears a wig.\"\\n\\n     It was a few moments before his meaning dawned on me.\\n\"You don\\'t mean that fable about the fantastic ear?\" I demanded.\\n\"I\\'ve heard of it, of course, but surely it must be a superstitious yarn\\nspun out of something much simpler.  I\\'ve sometimes thought it was\\na wild version of one of those mutilation stories.  They used to crop\\ncriminals\\' ears in the sixteenth century.\"\\n\\n     \"I hardly think it was that,\" answered the little man thoughtfully,\\n\"but it is not outside ordinary science or natural law for a family\\nto have some deformity frequently reappearing--such as one ear bigger\\nthan the other.\"\\n\\n     The big librarian had buried his big bald brow in his big red hands,\\nlike a man trying to think out his duty.  \"No,\" he groaned.\\n\"You do the man a wrong after all.  Understand, I\\'ve no reason\\nto defend him, or even keep faith with him.  He has been a tyrant to me\\nas to everybody else.  Don\\'t fancy because you see him sitting here\\nthat he isn\\'t a great lord in the worst sense of the word.\\nHe would fetch a man a mile to ring a bell a yard off--if it would\\nsummon another man three miles to fetch a matchbox three yards off.\\nHe must have a footman to carry his walking-stick; a body servant\\nto hold up his opera-glasses--\"\\n\\n     \"But not a valet to brush his clothes,\" cut in the priest,\\nwith a curious dryness, \"for the valet would want to brush his wig, too.\"\\n\\n     The librarian turned to him and seemed to forget my presence;\\nhe was strongly moved and, I think, a little heated with wine.\\n\"I don\\'t know how you know it, Father Brown,\" he said, \"but you are right.\\nHe lets the whole world do everything for him--except dress him.\\nAnd that he insists on doing in a literal solitude like a desert.\\nAnybody is kicked out of the house without a character who is\\nso much as found near his dressing-room door.,\\n\\n     \"He seems a pleasant old party,\" I remarked.\\n\\n     \"No,\" replied Dr Mull quite simply; \"and yet that is just what\\nI mean by saying you are unjust to him after all.  Gentlemen, the Duke\\ndoes really feel the bitterness about the curse that he uttered just now.\\nHe does, with sincere shame and terror, hide under that purple wig\\nsomething he thinks it would blast the sons of man to see.\\nI know it is so; and I know it is not a mere natural disfigurement,\\nlike a criminal mutilation, or a hereditary disproportion in the features.\\nI know it is worse than that; because a man told me who was present\\nat a scene that no man could invent, where a stronger man than\\nany of us tried to defy the secret, and was scared away from it.\"\\n\\n     I opened my mouth to speak, but Mull went on in oblivion of me,\\nspeaking out of the cavern of his hands.  \"I don\\'t mind telling you,\\nFather, because it\\'s really more defending the poor Duke than\\ngiving him away.  Didn\\'t you ever hear of the time when he\\nvery nearly lost all the estates?\"\\n\\n     The priest shook his head; and the librarian proceeded to\\ntell the tale as he had heard it from his predecessor in the same post,\\nwho had been his patron and instructor, and whom he seemed to trust\\nimplicitly.  Up to a certain point it was a common enough tale\\nof the decline of a great family\\'s fortunes--the tale of a family lawyer.\\nHis lawyer, however, had the sense to cheat honestly, if the expression\\nexplains itself.  Instead of using funds he held in trust,\\nhe took advantage of the Duke\\'s carelessness to put the family in\\na financial hole, in which it might be necessary for the Duke to\\nlet him hold them in reality.\\n\\n     The lawyer\\'s name was Isaac Green, but the Duke always called him\\nElisha; presumably in reference to the fact that he was quite bald,\\nthough certainly not more than thirty.  He had risen very rapidly,\\nbut from very dirty beginnings; being first a \"nark\" or informer,\\nand then a money-lender:  but as solicitor to the Eyres he had the sense,\\nas I say, to keep technically straight until he was ready to deal\\nthe final blow.  The blow fell at dinner; and the old librarian said\\nhe should never forget the very look of the lampshades and the decanters,\\nas the little lawyer, with a steady smile, proposed to the great landlord\\nthat they should halve the estates between them.  The sequel certainly\\ncould not be overlooked; for the Duke, in dead silence, smashed\\na decanter on the man\\'s bald head as suddenly as I had seen him smash\\nthe glass that day in the orchard.  It left a red triangular scar\\non the scalp, and the lawyer\\'s eyes altered, but not his smile.\\n\\n     He rose tottering to his feet, and struck back as such men do strike.\\n\"I am glad of that,\" he said, \"for now I can take the whole estate.\\nThe law will give it to me.\"\\n\\n     Exmoor, it seems, was white as ashes, but his eyes still blazed.\\n\"The law will give it you,\" he said; \"but you will not take it....\\nWhy not?  Why? because it would mean the crack of doom for me,\\nand if you take it I shall take off my wig....  Why, you pitiful\\nplucked fowl, anyone can see your bare head.  But no man shall\\nsee mine and live.\"\\n\\n     Well, you may say what you like and make it mean what you like.\\nBut Mull swears it is the solemn fact that the lawyer, after shaking\\nhis knotted fists in the air for an instant, simply ran from the room\\nand never reappeared in the countryside; and since then Exmoor has been\\nfeared more for a warlock than even for a landlord and a magistrate.\\n\\n     Now Dr Mull told his story with rather wild theatrical gestures,\\nand with a passion I think at least partisan.  I was quite conscious\\nof the possibility that the whole was the extravagance of\\nan old braggart and gossip.  But before I end this half of my discoveries,\\nI think it due to Dr Mull to record that my two first inquiries\\nhave confirmed his story.  I learned from an old apothecary in the village\\nthat there was a bald man in evening dress, giving the name of Green,\\nwho came to him one night to have a three-cornered cut on his forehead\\nplastered.  And I learnt from the legal records and old newspapers\\nthat there was a lawsuit threatened, and at least begun, by one Green\\nagainst the Duke of Exmoor.\\n\\n\\n     Mr Nutt, of the Daily Reformer, wrote some highly incongruous\\nwords across the top of the copy, made some highly mysterious marks\\ndown the side of it, and called to Miss Barlow in the same loud,\\nmonotonous voice:  \"Take down a letter to Mr Finn.\"\\n\\n     DEAR FINN,--Your copy will do, but I have had to headline it a bit;\\nand our public would never stand a Romanist priest in the story--\\nyou must keep your eye on the suburbs.  I\\'ve altered him to Mr Brown,\\na Spiritualist.\\n\\n                                             Yours,\\n\\n                                                  E.  NUTT.\\n\\n\\n     A day or two afterward found the active and judicious editor\\nexamining, with blue eyes that seemed to grow rounder and rounder,\\nthe second instalment of Mr Finn\\'s tale of mysteries in high life.\\nIt began with the words:\\n\\n\\n     I have made an astounding discovery.  I freely confess it is\\nquite different from anything I expected to discover, and will give\\na much more practical shock to the public.  I venture to say,\\nwithout any vanity, that the words I now write will be read all over Europe,\\nand certainly all over America and the Colonies.  And yet I heard\\nall I have to tell before I left this same little wooden table in this\\nsame little wood of apple-trees.\\n\\n     I owe it all to the small priest Brown; he is an extraordinary man.\\nThe big librarian had left the table, perhaps ashamed of his long tongue,\\nperhaps anxious about the storm in which his mysterious master\\nhad vanished:  anyway, he betook himself heavily in the Duke\\'s tracks\\nthrough the trees.  Father Brown had picked up one of the lemons and\\nwas eyeing it with an odd pleasure.\\n\\n     \"What a lovely colour a lemon is!\" he said.  \"There\\'s one thing\\nI don\\'t like about the Duke\\'s wig--the colour.\"\\n\\n     \"I don\\'t think I understand,\" I answered.\\n\\n     \"I dare say he\\'s got good reason to cover his ears, like King Midas,\"\\nwent on the priest, with a cheerful simplicity which somehow seemed\\nrather flippant under the circumstances.  \"I can quite understand\\nthat it\\'s nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plates or\\nleather flaps.  But if he wants to use hair, why doesn\\'t he make it\\nlook like hair?  There never was hair of that colour in this world.\\nIt looks more like a sunset-cloud coming through the wood.\\nWhy doesn\\'t he conceal the family curse better, if he\\'s really\\nso ashamed of it?  Shall I tell you?  It\\'s because he isn\\'t ashamed of it.\\nHe\\'s proud of it\"\\n\\n     \"It\\'s an ugly wig to be proud of--and an ugly story,\" I said.\\n\\n     \"Consider,\" replied this curious little man, \"how you yourself\\nreally feel about such things.  I don\\'t suggest you\\'re either\\nmore snobbish or more morbid than the rest of us:  but don\\'t you feel\\nin a vague way that a genuine old family curse is rather a fine thing\\nto have?  Would you be ashamed, wouldn\\'t you be a little proud,\\nif the heir of the Glamis horror called you his friend? or if Byron\\'s\\nfamily had confided, to you only, the evil adventures of their race?\\nDon\\'t be too hard on the aristocrats themselves if their heads are\\nas weak as ours would be, and they are snobs about their own sorrows.\"\\n\\n     \"By Jove!\" I cried; \"and that\\'s true enough.  My own mother\\'s family\\nhad a banshee; and, now I come to think of it, it has comforted me\\nin many a cold hour.\"\\n\\n     \"And think,\" he went on, \"of that stream of blood and poison\\nthat spurted from his thin lips the instant you so much as mentioned\\nhis ancestors.  Why should he show every stranger over such\\na Chamber of Horrors unless he is proud of it?  He doesn\\'t conceal his wig,\\nhe doesn\\'t conceal his blood, he doesn\\'t conceal his family curse,\\nhe doesn\\'t conceal the family crimes--but--\"\\n\\n     The little man\\'s voice changed so suddenly, he shut his hand\\nso sharply, and his eyes so rapidly grew rounder and brighter\\nlike a waking owl\\'s, that it had all the abruptness of a small explosion\\non the table.\\n\\n     \"But,\" he ended, \"he does really conceal his toilet.\"\\n\\n     It somehow completed the thrill of my fanciful nerves that\\nat that instant the Duke appeared again silently among the glimmering trees,\\nwith his soft foot and sunset-hued hair, coming round the corner of\\nthe house in company with his librarian.  Before he came within earshot,\\nFather Brown had added quite composedly, \"Why does he really hide\\nthe secret of what he does with the purple wig?  Because it isn\\'t\\nthe sort of secret we suppose.\"\\n\\n     The Duke came round the corner and resumed his seat at the head\\nof the table with all his native dignity.  The embarrassment of\\nthe librarian left him hovering on his hind legs, like a huge bear.\\nThe Duke addressed the priest with great seriousness.  \"Father Brown,\"\\nhe said, \"Doctor Mull informs me that you have come here to make a request.\\nI no longer profess an observance of the religion of my fathers;\\nbut for their sakes, and for the sake of the days when we met before,\\nI am very willing to hear you.  But I presume you would rather\\nbe heard in private.\"\\n\\n     Whatever I retain of the gentleman made me stand up.\\nWhatever I have attained of the journalist made me stand still.\\nBefore this paralysis could pass, the priest had made a momentarily\\ndetaining motion.  \"If,\" he said, \"your Grace will permit me\\nmy real petition, or if I retain any right to advise you, I would urge\\nthat as many people as possible should be present.  All over this country\\nI have found hundreds, even of my own faith and flock, whose imaginations\\nare poisoned by the spell which I implore you to break.  I wish we could\\nhave all Devonshire here to see you do it.\"\\n\\n     \"To see me do what?\" asked the Duke, arching his eyebrows.\\n\\n     \"To see you take off your wig,\" said Father Brown.\\n\\n     The Duke\\'s face did not move; but he looked at his petitioner\\nwith a glassy stare which was the most awful expression I have ever seen\\non a human face.  I could see the librarian\\'s great legs wavering\\nunder him like the shadows of stems in a pool; and I could not banish\\nfrom my own brain the fancy that the trees all around us were\\nfilling softly in the silence with devils instead of birds.\\n\\n     \"I spare you,\" said the Duke in a voice of inhuman pity.\\n\"I refuse.  If I gave you the faintest hint of the load of horror\\nI have to bear alone, you would lie shrieking at these feet of mine\\nand begging to know no more.  I will spare you the hint.\\nYou shall not spell the first letter of what is written on\\nthe altar of the Unknown God.\"\\n\\n     \"I know the Unknown God,\" said the little priest, with an\\nunconscious grandeur of certitude that stood up like a granite tower.\\n\"I know his name; it is Satan.  The true God was made flesh\\nand dwelt among us.  And I say to you, wherever you find men ruled\\nmerely by mystery, it is the mystery of iniquity.  If the devil\\ntells you something is too fearful to look at, look at it.\\nIf he says something is too terrible to hear, hear it.  If you think\\nsome truth unbearable, bear it.  I entreat your Grace to end\\nthis nightmare now and here at this table.\"\\n\\n     \"If I did,\" said the Duke in a low voice, \"you and all you believe,\\nand all by which alone you live, would be the first to shrivel and perish.\\nYou would have an instant to know the great Nothing before you died.\"\\n\\n     \"The Cross of Christ be between me and harm,\" said Father Brown.\\n\"Take off your wig.\"\\n\\n     I was leaning over the table in ungovernable excitement;\\nin listening to this extraordinary duel half a thought had\\ncome into my head.  \"Your Grace,\" I cried, \"I call your bluff.\\nTake off that wig or I will knock it off.\"\\n\\n     I suppose I can be prosecuted for assault, but I am very glad\\nI did it.  When he said, in the same voice of stone, \"I refuse,\"\\nI simply sprang on him.  For three long instants he strained against me\\nas if he had all hell to help him; but I forced his head until\\nthe hairy cap fell off it.  I admit that, whilst wrestling,\\nI shut my eyes as it fell.\\n\\n     I was awakened by a cry from Mull, who was also by this time\\nat the Duke\\'s side.  His head and mine were both bending over\\nthe bald head of the wigless Duke.  Then the silence was snapped\\nby the librarian exclaiming:  \"What can it mean?  Why, the man had\\nnothing to hide.  His ears are just like everybody else\\'s.\"\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" said Father Brown, \"that is what he had to hide.\"\\n\\n     The priest walked straight up to him, but strangely enough\\ndid not even glance at his ears.  He stared with an almost comical\\nseriousness at his bald forehead, and pointed to a three-cornered\\ncicatrice, long healed, but still discernible.  \"Mr Green, I think.\"\\nhe said politely, \"and he did get the whole estate after all.\"\\n\\n     And now let me tell the readers of the Daily Reformer\\nwhat I think the most remarkable thing in the whole affair.\\nThis transformation scene, which will seem to you as wild and purple\\nas a Persian fairy-tale, has been (except for my technical assault)\\nstrictly legal and constitutional from its first beginnings.\\nThis man with the odd scar and the ordinary ears is not an impostor.\\nThough (in one sense) he wears another man\\'s wig and claims\\nanother man\\'s ear, he has not stolen another man\\'s coronet.\\nHe really is the one and only Duke of Exmoor.  What happened was this.\\nThe old Duke really had a slight malformation of the ear, which really\\nwas more or less hereditary.  He really was morbid about it;\\nand it is likely enough that he did invoke it as a kind of curse\\nin the violent scene (which undoubtedly happened) in which he struck\\nGreen with the decanter.  But the contest ended very differently.\\nGreen pressed his claim and got the estates; the dispossessed nobleman\\nshot himself and died without issue.  After a decent interval\\nthe beautiful English Government revived the \"extinct\" peerage of Exmoor,\\nand bestowed it, as is usual, on the most important person,\\nthe person who had got the property.\\n\\n     This man used the old feudal fables--properly, in his snobbish soul,\\nreally envied and admired them.  So that thousands of poor English people\\ntrembled before a mysterious chieftain with an ancient destiny and\\na diadem of evil stars--when they are really trembling before\\na guttersnipe who was a pettifogger and a pawnbroker not twelve years ago.\\nI think it very typical of the real case against our aristocracy as it is,\\nand as it will be till God sends us braver men.\\n\\n\\n     Mr Nutt put down the manuscript and called out with unusual\\nsharpness:  \"Miss Barlow, please take down a letter to Mr Finn.\"\\n\\n     DEAR FINN,--You must be mad; we can\\'t touch this.  I wanted vampires\\nand the bad old days and aristocracy hand-in-hand with superstition.\\nThey like that But you must know the Exmoors would never forgive this.\\nAnd what would our people say then, I should like to know!  Why, Sir Simon\\nis one of Exmoor\\'s greatest pals; and it would ruin that cousin of\\nthe Eyres that\\'s standing for us at Bradford.  Besides, old Soap-Suds\\nwas sick enough at not getting his peerage last year; he\\'d sack me by wire\\nif I lost him it with such lunacy as this.  And what about Duffey?\\nHe\\'s doing us some rattling articles on \"The Heel of the Norman.\"\\nAnd how can he write about Normans if the man\\'s only a solicitor?\\nDo be reasonable.--Yours, E. NUTT.\\n\\n     As Miss Barlow rattled away cheerfully, he crumpled up the copy\\nand tossed it into the waste-paper basket; but not before he had,\\nautomatically and by force of habit, altered the word \"God\"\\nto the word \"circumstances.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. The Perishing of the Pendragons\\n\\n\\nFATHER BROWN was in no mood for adventures.  He had lately fallen ill\\nwith over-work, and when he began to recover, his friend Flambeau\\nhad taken him on a cruise in a small yacht with Sir Cecil Fanshaw,\\na young Cornish squire and an enthusiast for Cornish coast scenery.\\nBut Brown was still rather weak; he was no very happy sailor;\\nand though he was never of the sort that either grumbles or breaks down,\\nhis spirits did not rise above patience and civility.  When the other\\ntwo men praised the ragged violet sunset or the ragged volcanic crags,\\nhe agreed with them.  When Flambeau pointed out a rock shaped\\nlike a dragon, he looked at it and thought it very like a dragon.\\nWhen Fanshaw more excitedly indicated a rock that was like Merlin,\\nhe looked at it, and signified assent.  When Flambeau asked whether\\nthis rocky gate of the twisted river was not the gate of Fairyland,\\nhe said \"Yes.\"  He heard the most important things and the most trivial\\nwith the same tasteless absorption.  He heard that the coast was death\\nto all but careful seamen; he also heard that the ship\\'s cat was asleep.\\nHe heard that Fanshaw couldn\\'t find his cigar-holder anywhere;\\nhe also heard the pilot deliver the oracle \"Both eyes bright,\\nshe\\'s all right; one eye winks, down she sinks.\"  He heard Flambeau\\nsay to Fanshaw that no doubt this meant the pilot must keep both eyes\\nopen and be spry.  And he heard Fanshaw say to Flambeau that,\\noddly enough, it didn\\'t mean this:  it meant that while they\\nsaw two of the coast lights, one near and the other distant,\\nexactly side by side, they were in the right river-channel;\\nbut that if one light was hidden behind the other, they were going\\non the rocks.  He heard Fanshaw add that his country was full of\\nsuch quaint fables and idioms; it was the very home of romance;\\nhe even pitted this part of Cornwall against Devonshire, as a claimant\\nto the laurels of Elizabethan seamanship.  According to him\\nthere had been captains among these coves and islets compared with whom\\nDrake was practically a landsman.  He heard Flambeau laugh, and ask if,\\nperhaps, the adventurous title of \"Westward Ho!\" only meant that\\nall Devonshire men wished they were living in Cornwall.  He heard Fanshaw\\nsay there was no need to be silly; that not only had Cornish captains\\nbeen heroes, but that they were heroes still:  that near that very spot\\nthere was an old admiral, now retired, who was scarred by thrilling voyages\\nfull of adventures; and who had in his youth found the last group\\nof eight Pacific Islands that was added to the chart of the world.\\nThis Cecil Fanshaw was, in person, of the kind that commonly urges\\nsuch crude but pleasing enthusiasms; a very young man, light-haired,\\nhigh-coloured, with an eager profile; with a boyish bravado of spirits,\\nbut an almost girlish delicacy of tint and type.  The big shoulders,\\nblack brows and black mousquetaire swagger of Flambeau\\nwere a great contrast.\\n\\n     All these trivialities Brown heard and saw; but heard them\\nas a tired man hears a tune in the railway wheels, or saw them\\nas a sick man sees the pattern of his wall-paper.  No one can calculate\\nthe turns of mood in convalescence:  but Father Brown\\'s depression\\nmust have had a great deal to do with his mere unfamiliarity with the sea.\\nFor as the river mouth narrowed like the neck of a bottle,\\nand the water grew calmer and the air warmer and more earthly,\\nhe seemed to wake up and take notice like a baby.  They had reached\\nthat phase just after sunset when air and water both look bright,\\nbut earth and all its growing things look almost black by comparison.\\nAbout this particular  evening, however, there was something exceptional.\\nIt was one of those rare atmospheres in which a smoked-glass slide\\nseems to have been slid away from between us and Nature; so that even\\ndark colours on that day look more gorgeous than bright colours\\non cloudier days.  The trampled earth of the river-banks and\\nthe peaty stain in the pools did not look drab but glowing umber,\\nand the dark woods astir in the breeze did not look, as usual, dim blue\\nwith mere depth of distance, but more like wind-tumbled masses of some\\nvivid violet blossom.  This magic clearness and intensity in the colours\\nwas further forced on Brown\\'s slowly reviving senses by something\\nromantic and even secret in the very form of the landscape.\\n\\n     The river was still well wide and deep enough for a pleasure boat\\nso small as theirs; but the curves of the country-side suggested\\nthat it was closing in on either hand; the woods seemed to be making\\nbroken and flying attempts at bridge-building--as if the boat\\nwere passing from the romance of a valley to the romance of a hollow\\nand so to the supreme romance of a tunnel.  Beyond this mere\\nlook of things there was little for Brown\\'s freshening fancy to feed on;\\nhe saw no human beings, except some gipsies trailing along the river bank,\\nwith faggots and osiers cut in the forest; and one sight\\nno longer unconventional, but in such remote parts still uncommon:\\na dark-haired lady, bare-headed, and paddling her own canoe.\\nIf Father Brown ever attached any importance to either of these,\\nhe certainly forgot them at the next turn of the river which\\nbrought in sight a singular object.\\n\\n     The water seemed to widen and split, being cloven by the dark wedge\\nof a fish-shaped and wooded islet.  With the rate at which they went,\\nthe islet seemed to swim towards them like a ship; a ship with\\na very high prow--or, to speak more strictly, a very high funnel.\\nFor at the extreme point nearest them stood up an odd-looking building,\\nunlike anything they could remember or connect with any purpose.\\nIt was not specially high, but it was too high for its breadth\\nto be called anything but a tower.  Yet it appeared to be built\\nentirely of wood, and that in a most unequal and eccentric way.\\nSome of the planks and beams were of good, seasoned oak; some of\\nsuch wood cut raw and recent; some again of white pinewood,\\nand a great deal more of the same sort of wood painted black with tar.\\nThese black beams were set crooked or crisscross at all kinds of angles,\\ngiving the whole a most patchy and puzzling appearance.\\nThere were one or two windows, which appeared to be coloured and\\nleaded in an old-fashioned but more elaborate style.  The travellers\\nlooked at it with that paradoxical feeling we have when something\\nreminds us of something, and yet we are certain it is something\\nvery different.\\n\\n     Father Brown, even when he was mystified, was clever in analysing\\nhis own mystification.  And he found himself reflecting that\\nthe oddity seemed to consist in a particular shape cut out in\\nan incongruous material; as if one saw a top-hat made of tin,\\nor a frock-coat cut out of tartan.  He was sure he had seen timbers\\nof different tints arranged like that somewhere, but never\\nin such architectural proportions.  The next moment a glimpse\\nthrough the dark trees told him all he wanted to know and he laughed.\\nThrough a gap in the foliage there appeared for a moment one of those\\nold wooden houses, faced with black beams, which are still to be found\\nhere and there in England, but which most of us see imitated\\nin some show called \"Old London\" or \"Shakespeare\\'s England\\'.\\nIt was in view only long enough for the priest to see that,\\nhowever old-fashioned, it was a comfortable and well-kept country-house,\\nwith flower-beds in front of it.  It had none of the piebald and crazy\\nlook of the tower that seemed made out of its refuse.\\n\\n     \"What on earth\\'s this?\" said Flambeau, who was still staring\\nat the tower.\\n\\n     Fanshaw\\'s eyes were shining, and he spoke triumphantly.\\n\"Aha! you\\'ve not seen a place quite like this before, I fancy;\\nthat\\'s why I\\'ve brought you here, my friend.  Now you shall see\\nwhether I exaggerate about the mariners of Cornwall.  This place belongs\\nto Old Pendragon, whom we call the Admiral; though he retired\\nbefore getting the rank.  The spirit of Raleigh and Hawkins is a memory\\nwith the Devon folk; it\\'s a modern fact with the Pendragons.\\nIf Queen Elizabeth were to rise from the grave and come up this river\\nin a gilded barge, she would be received by the Admiral in a house\\nexactly such as she was accustomed to, in every corner and casement,\\nin every panel on the wall or plate on the table.  And she would find\\nan English Captain still talking fiercely of fresh lands to be found\\nin little ships, as much as if she had dined with Drake.\"\\n\\n     \"She\\'d find a rum sort of thing in the garden,\" said Father Brown,\\n\"which would not please her Renaissance eye.  That Elizabethan domestic\\narchitecture is charming in its way; but it\\'s against the very nature\\nof it to break out into turrets.\"\\n\\n     \"And yet,\" answered Fanshaw, \"that\\'s the most romantic and\\nElizabethan part of the business.  It was built by the Pendragons\\nin the very days of the Spanish wars; and though it\\'s needed patching\\nand even rebuilding for another reason, it\\'s always been rebuilt\\nin the old way.  The story goes that the lady of Sir Peter Pendragon\\nbuilt it in this place and to this height, because from the top\\nyou can just see the corner where vessels turn into the river mouth;\\nand she wished to be the first to see her husband\\'s ship,\\nas he sailed home from the Spanish Main.\"\\n\\n     \"For what other reason,\" asked Father Brown, \"do you mean that\\nit has been rebuilt?\"\\n\\n     \"Oh, there\\'s a strange story about that, too,\" said the young squire\\nwith relish.  \"You are really in a land of strange stories.\\nKing Arthur was here and Merlin and the fairies before him.\\nThe story goes that Sir Peter Pendragon, who (I fear) had some of\\nthe faults of the pirates as well as the virtues of the sailor,\\nwas bringing home three Spanish gentlemen in honourable captivity,\\nintending to escort them to Elizabeth\\'s court.  But he was a man\\nof flaming and tigerish temper, and coming to high words with one of them,\\nhe caught him by the throat and flung him by accident or design,\\ninto the sea.  A second Spaniard, who was the brother of the first,\\ninstantly drew his sword and flew at Pendragon, and after a short but\\nfurious combat in which both got three wounds in as many minutes,\\nPendragon drove his blade through the other\\'s body and the second Spaniard\\nwas accounted for.  As it happened the ship had already turned\\ninto the river mouth and was close to comparatively shallow water.\\nThe third Spaniard sprang over the side of the ship, struck out\\nfor the shore, and was soon near enough to it to stand up to his waist\\nin water.  And turning again to face the ship, and holding up both\\narms to Heaven--like a prophet calling plagues upon a wicked city--\\nhe called out to Pendragon in a piercing and terrible voice,\\nthat he at least was yet living, that he would go on living,\\nthat he would live for ever; and that generation after generation\\nthe house of Pendragon should never see him or his, but should know\\nby very certain signs that he and his vengeance were alive.\\nWith that he dived under the wave, and was either drowned or swam\\nso long under water that no hair of his head was seen afterwards.\"\\n\\n     \"There\\'s that girl in the canoe again,\" said Flambeau irrelevantly,\\nfor good-looking young women would call him off any topic.\\n\"She seems bothered by the queer tower just as we were.\"\\n\\n     Indeed, the black-haired young lady was letting her canoe float\\nslowly and silently past the strange islet; and was looking intently up\\nat the strange tower, with a strong glow of curiosity on her oval\\nand olive face.\\n\\n     \"Never mind girls,\" said Fanshaw impatiently, \"there are plenty\\nof them in the world, but not many things like the Pendragon Tower.\\nAs you may easily suppose, plenty of superstitions and scandals\\nhave followed in the track of the Spaniard\\'s curse; and no doubt,\\nas you would put it, any accident happening to this Cornish family\\nwould be connected with it by rural credulity.  But it is perfectly true\\nthat this tower has been burnt down two or three times; and the family\\ncan\\'t be called lucky, for more than two, I think, of the Admiral\\'s\\nnear kin have perished by shipwreck; and one at least, to my own knowledge,\\non practically the same spot where Sir Peter threw the Spaniard overboard.\"\\n\\n     \"What a pity!\" exclaimed Flambeau.  \"She\\'s going.\"\\n\\n     \"When did your friend the Admiral tell you this family history?\"\\nasked Father Brown, as the girl in the canoe paddled off,\\nwithout showing the least intention of extending her interest from\\nthe tower to the yacht, which Fanshaw had already caused to lie\\nalongside the island.\\n\\n     \"Many years ago,\" replied Fanshaw; \"he hasn\\'t been to sea for\\nsome time now, though he is as keen on it as ever.  I believe there\\'s\\na family compact or something.  Well, here\\'s the landing stage;\\nlet\\'s come ashore and see the old boy.\"\\n\\n     They followed him on to the island, just under the tower,\\nand Father Brown, whether from the mere touch of dry land, or the interest\\nof something on the other bank of the river (which he stared at\\nvery hard for some seconds), seemed singularly improved in briskness.\\nThey entered a wooded avenue between two fences of thin greyish wood,\\nsuch as often enclose parks or gardens, and over the top of which\\nthe dark trees tossed to and fro like black and purple plumes upon\\nthe hearse of a giant.  The tower, as they left it behind,\\nlooked all the quainter, because such entrances are usually flanked\\nby two towers; and this one looked lopsided.  But for this, the avenue\\nhad the usual appearance of the entrance to a gentleman\\'s grounds;\\nand, being so curved that the house was now out of sight,\\nsomehow looked a much larger park than any plantation on such an island\\ncould really be.  Father Brown was, perhaps, a little fanciful\\nin his fatigue, but he almost thought the whole place must be\\ngrowing larger, as things do in a nightmare.  Anyhow, a mystical monotony\\nwas the only character of their march, until Fanshaw suddenly stopped,\\nand pointed to something sticking out through the grey fence--\\nsomething that looked at first rather like the imprisoned horn\\nof some beast.  Closer observation showed that it was\\na slightly curved blade of metal that shone faintly in the fading light.\\n\\n     Flambeau, who like all Frenchmen had been a soldier, bent over it\\nand said in a startled voice:  \"Why, it\\'s a sabre!  I believe\\nI know the sort, heavy and curved, but shorter than the cavalry;\\nthey used to have them in artillery and the--\"\\n\\n     As he spoke the blade plucked itself out of the crack it had made\\nand came down again with a more ponderous slash, splitting\\nthe fissiparous fence to the bottom with a rending noise.\\nThen it was pulled out again, flashed above the fence some feet\\nfurther along, and again split it halfway down with the first stroke;\\nand after waggling a little to extricate itself (accompanied with\\ncurses in the darkness) split it down to the ground with a second.\\nThen a kick of devilish energy sent the whole loosened square\\nof thin wood flying into the pathway, and a great gap of dark coppice\\ngaped in the paling.\\n\\n     Fanshaw peered into the dark opening and uttered an exclamation\\nof astonishment.  \"My dear Admiral!\" he exclaimed, \"do you--er--\\ndo you generally cut out a new front door whenever you want to\\ngo for a walk?\"\\n\\n     The voice in the gloom swore again, and then broke into a jolly laugh.\\n\"No,\" it said; \"I\\'ve really got to cut down this fence somehow;\\nit\\'s spoiling all the plants, and no one else here can do it.\\nBut I\\'ll only carve another bit off the front door, and then come out\\nand welcome you.\"\\n\\n     And sure enough, he heaved up his weapon once more, and,\\nhacking twice, brought down another and similar strip of fence,\\nmaking the opening about fourteen feet wide in all.  Then through this\\nlarger forest gateway he came out into the evening light,\\nwith a chip of grey wood sticking to his sword-blade.\\n\\n     He momentarily fulfilled all Fanshaw\\'s fable of an old piratical\\nAdmiral; though the details seemed afterwards to decompose into accidents.\\nFor instance, he wore a broad-brimmed hat as protection against the sun;\\nbut the front flap of it was turned up straight to the sky, and the\\ntwo corners pulled down lower than the ears, so that it stood across\\nhis forehead in a crescent like the old cocked hat worn by Nelson.\\nHe wore an ordinary dark-blue jacket, with nothing special about\\nthe buttons, but the combination of it with white linen trousers\\nsomehow had a sailorish look.  He was tall and loose, and walked with\\na sort of swagger, which was not a sailor\\'s roll, and yet somehow\\nsuggested it; and he held in his hand a short sabre which was like\\na navy cutlass, but about twice as big.  Under the bridge of the hat\\nhis eagle face looked eager, all the more because it was not only\\nclean-shaven, but without eyebrows.  It seemed almost as if all\\nthe hair had come off his face from his thrusting it through\\na throng of elements.  His eyes were prominent and piercing.\\nHis colour was curiously attractive, while partly tropical;\\nit reminded one vaguely of a blood-orange.  That is, that while it was\\nruddy and sanguine, there was a yellow in it that was in no way sickly,\\nbut seemed rather to glow like gold apples of the Hesperides--\\nFather Brown thought he had never seen a figure so expressive\\nof all the romances about the countries of the Sun.\\n\\n     When Fanshaw had presented his two friends to their host\\nhe fell again into a tone of rallying the latter about his wreckage\\nof the fence and his apparent rage of profanity.  The Admiral pooh-poohed\\nit at first as a piece of necessary but annoying garden work;\\nbut at length the ring of real energy came back into his laughter,\\nand he cried with a mixture of impatience and good humour:\\n\\n     \"Well, perhaps I do go at it a bit rabidly, and feel\\na kind of pleasure in smashing anything.  So would you if your\\nonly pleasure was in cruising about to find some new Cannibal Islands,\\nand you had to stick on this muddy little rockery in a sort of rustic pond.\\nWhen I remember how I\\'ve cut down a mile and a half of green poisonous\\njungle with an old cutlass half as sharp as this; and then remember\\nI must stop here and chop this matchwood, because of some confounded\\nold bargain scribbled in a family Bible, why, I--\"\\n\\n     He swung up the heavy steel again; and this time sundered\\nthe wall of wood from top to bottom at one stroke.\\n\\n     \"I feel like that,\" he said laughing, but furiously flinging\\nthe sword some yards down the path, \"and now let\\'s go up to the house;\\nyou must have some dinner.\"\\n\\n     The semicircle of lawn in front of the house was varied by\\nthree circular garden beds, one of red tulips, a second of\\nyellow tulips, and the third of some white, waxen-looking blossoms\\nthat the visitors did not know and presumed to be exotic.\\nA heavy, hairy and rather sullen-looking gardener was hanging up\\na heavy coil of garden hose.  The corners of the expiring sunset\\nwhich seemed to cling about the corners of the house gave glimpses\\nhere and there of the colours of remoter flowerbeds; and in\\na treeless space on one side of the house opening upon the river\\nstood a tall brass tripod on which was tilted a big brass telescope.\\nJust outside the steps of the porch stood a little painted\\ngreen garden table, as if someone had just had tea there.\\nThe entrance was flanked with two of those half-featured lumps of stone\\nwith holes for eyes that are said to be South Sea idols; and on\\nthe brown oak beam across the doorway were some confused carvings\\nthat looked almost as barbaric.\\n\\n     As they passed indoors, the little cleric hopped suddenly\\non to the table, and standing on it peered unaffectedly\\nthrough his spectacles at the mouldings in the oak.  Admiral Pendragon\\nlooked very much astonished, though not particularly annoyed;\\nwhile Fanshaw was so amused with what looked like a performing pigmy\\non his little stand, that he could not control his laughter.\\nBut Father Brown was not likely to notice either the laughter\\nor the astonishment.\\n\\n     He was gazing at three carved symbols, which, though very worn\\nand obscure, seemed still to convey some sense to him.  The first\\nseemed to be the outline of some tower or other building, crowned with\\nwhat looked like curly-pointed ribbons.  The second was clearer:\\nan old Elizabethan galley with decorative waves beneath it,\\nbut interrupted in the middle by a curious jagged rock, which was either\\na fault in the wood or some conventional representation of the water\\ncoming in.  The third represented the upper half of a human figure,\\nending in an escalloped line like the waves; the face was rubbed\\nand featureless, and both arms were held very stiffly up in the air.\\n\\n     \"Well,\" muttered Father Brown, blinking, \"here is the legend\\nof the Spaniard plain enough.  Here he is holding up his arms\\nand cursing in the sea; and here are the two curses:  the wrecked ship\\nand the burning of Pendragon Tower.\"\\n\\n     Pendragon shook his head with a kind of venerable amusement.\\n\"And how many other things might it not be?\" he said.  \"Don\\'t you know\\nthat that sort of half-man, like a half-lion or half-stag,\\nis quite common in heraldry?  Might not that line through the ship\\nbe one of those parti-per-pale lines, indented, I think they call it?\\nAnd though the third thing isn\\'t so very heraldic, it would be\\nmore heraldic to suppose it a tower crowned with laurel than with fire;\\nand it looks just as like it.\"\\n\\n     \"But it seems rather odd,\" said Flambeau, \"that it should\\nexactly confirm the old legend.\"\\n\\n     \"Ah,\" replied the sceptical traveller, \"but you don\\'t know\\nhow much of the old legend may have been made up from the old figures.\\nBesides, it isn\\'t the only old legend.  Fanshaw, here, who is\\nfond of such things, will tell you there are other versions of the tale,\\nand much more horrible ones.  One story credits my unfortunate ancestor\\nwith having had the Spaniard cut in two; and that will fit\\nthe pretty picture also.  Another obligingly credits our family\\nwith the possession of a tower full of snakes and explains those little,\\nwriggly things in that way.  And a third theory supposes the crooked line\\non the ship to be a conventionalized thunderbolt; but that alone,\\nif seriously examined, would show what a very little way these\\nunhappy coincidences really go.\"\\n\\n     \"Why, how do you mean?\" asked Fanshaw.\\n\\n     \"It so happens,\" replied his host coolly, \"that there was\\nno thunder and lightning at all in the two or three shipwrecks\\nI know of in our family.\"\\n\\n     \"Oh!\" said Father Brown, and jumped down from the little table.\\n\\n     There was another silence in which they heard the continuous murmur\\nof the river; then Fanshaw said, in a doubtful and perhaps\\ndisappointed tone:  \"Then you don\\'t think there is anything in the\\ntales of the tower in flames?\"\\n\\n     \"There are the tales, of course,\" said the Admiral,\\nshrugging his shoulders; \"and some of them, I don\\'t deny,\\non evidence as decent as one ever gets for such things.\\nSomeone saw a blaze hereabout, don\\'t you know, as he walked home\\nthrough a wood; someone keeping sheep on the uplands inland thought\\nhe saw a flame hovering over Pendragon Tower.  Well, a damp dab of mud\\nlike this confounded island seems the last place where one would\\nthink of fires.\"\\n\\n     \"What is that fire over there?\" asked Father Brown with\\na gentle suddenness, pointing to the woods on the left river-bank.\\nThey were all thrown a little off their balance, and the more fanciful\\nFanshaw had even some difficulty in recovering his, as they saw a long,\\nthin stream of blue smoke ascending silently into the end of\\nthe evening light.\\n\\n     Then Pendragon broke into a scornful laugh again.  \"Gipsies!\"\\nhe said; \"they\\'ve been camping about here for about a week.\\nGentlemen, you want your dinner,\" and he turned as if to enter the house.\\n\\n     But the antiquarian superstition in Fanshaw was still quivering,\\nand he said hastily:  \"But, Admiral, what\\'s that hissing noise\\nquite near the island?  It\\'s very like fire.\"\\n\\n     \"It\\'s more like what it is,\" said the Admiral, laughing as he\\nled the way; \"it\\'s only some canoe going by.\"\\n\\n     Almost as he spoke, the butler, a lean man in black,\\nwith very black hair and a very long, yellow face, appeared in the doorway\\nand told him that dinner was served.\\n\\n     The dining-room was as nautical as the cabin of a ship;\\nbut its note was rather that of the modern than the Elizabethan captain.\\nThere were, indeed, three antiquated cutlasses in a trophy over\\nthe fireplace, and one brown sixteenth-century map with Tritons\\nand little ships dotted about a curly sea.  But such things were\\nless prominent on the white panelling than some cases of quaint-coloured\\nSouth American birds, very scientifically stuffed, fantastic shells\\nfrom the Pacific, and several instruments so rude and queer in shape\\nthat savages might have used them either to kill their enemies or\\nto cook them.  But the alien colour culminated in the fact that,\\nbesides the butler, the Admiral\\'s only servants were two negroes,\\nsomewhat quaintly clad in tight uniforms of yellow.  The priest\\'s\\ninstinctive trick of analysing his own impressions told him that\\nthe colour and the little neat coat-tails of these bipeds had suggested\\nthe word \"Canary,\" and so by a mere pun connected them with\\nsouthward travel.  Towards the end of the dinner they took their\\nyellow clothes and black faces out of the room, leaving only\\nthe black clothes and yellow face of the butler.\\n\\n     \"I\\'m rather sorry you take this so lightly,\" said Fanshaw to the host;\\n\"for the truth is, I\\'ve brought these friends of mine with the idea\\nof their helping you, as they know a good deal of these things.\\nDon\\'t you really believe in the family story at all?\"\\n\\n     \"I don\\'t believe in anything,\" answered Pendragon very briskly,\\nwith a bright eye cocked at a red tropical bird.  \"I\\'m a man of science.\"\\n\\n     Rather to Flambeau\\'s surprise, his clerical friend,\\nwho seemed to have entirely woken up, took up the digression and\\ntalked natural history with his host with a flow of words and\\nmuch unexpected information, until the dessert and decanters were\\nset down and the last of the servants vanished.  Then he said,\\nwithout altering his tone.\\n\\n     \"Please don\\'t think me impertinent, Admiral Pendragon.  I don\\'t\\nask for curiosity, but really for my guidance and your convenience.\\nHave I made a bad shot if I guess you don\\'t want these old things\\ntalked of before your butler?\"\\n\\n     The Admiral lifted the hairless arches over his eyes and exclaimed:\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know where you got it, but the truth is I can\\'t stand\\nthe fellow, though I\\'ve no excuse for discharging a family servant.\\nFanshaw, with his fairy tales, would say my blood moved against men\\nwith that black, Spanish-looking hair.\"\\n\\n     Flambeau struck the table with his heavy fist.  \"By Jove!\" he cried;\\n\"and so had that girl!\"\\n\\n     \"I hope it\\'ll all end tonight,\" continued the Admiral,\\n\"when my nephew comes back safe from his ship.  You looked surprised.\\nYou won\\'t understand, I suppose, unless I tell you the story.\\nYou see, my father had two sons; I remained a bachelor,\\nbut my elder brother married, and had a son who became a sailor\\nlike all the rest of us, and will inherit the proper estate.\\nWell, my father was a strange man; he somehow combined Fanshaw\\'s\\nsuperstition with a good deal of my scepticism--they were always\\nfighting in him; and after my first voyages, he developed a notion\\nwhich he thought somehow would settle finally whether the curse\\nwas truth or trash.  If all the Pendragons sailed about anyhow,\\nhe thought there would be too much chance of natural catastrophes\\nto prove anything.  But if we went to sea one at a time in strict order\\nof succession to the property, he thought it might show whether any\\nconnected fate followed the family as a family.  It was a silly notion,\\nI think, and I quarrelled with my father pretty heartily; for I was\\nan ambitious man and was left to the last, coming, by succession,\\nafter my own nephew.\"\\n\\n     \"And your father and brother,\" said the priest, very gently,\\n\"died at sea, I fear.\"\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" groaned the Admiral; \"by one of those brutal accidents\\non which are built all the lying mythologies of mankind,\\nthey were both shipwrecked.  My father, coming up this coast\\nout of the Atlantic, was washed up on these Cornish rocks.\\nMy brother\\'s ship was sunk, no one knows where, on the voyage home\\nfrom Tasmania.  His body was never found.  I tell you it was\\nfrom perfectly natural mishap; lots of other people besides Pendragons\\nwere drowned; and both disasters are discussed in a normal way\\nby navigators.  But, of course, it set this forest of superstition on fire;\\nand men saw the flaming tower everywhere.  That\\'s why I say it will\\nbe all right when Walter returns.  The girl he\\'s engaged to was\\ncoming today; but I was so afraid of some chance delay frightening her\\nthat I wired her not to come till she heard from me.  But he\\'s practically\\nsure to be here some time tonight, and then it\\'ll all end in smoke--\\ntobacco smoke.  We\\'ll crack that old lie when we crack a bottle\\nof this wine.\"\\n\\n     \"Very good wine,\" said Father Brown, gravely lifting his glass,\\n\"but, as you see, a very bad wine-bibber.  I most sincerely\\nbeg your pardon\":  for he had spilt a small spot of wine on\\nthe table-cloth.  He drank and put down the glass with a composed face;\\nbut his hand had started at the exact moment when he became conscious\\nof a face looking in through the garden window just behind the Admiral--\\nthe face of a woman, swarthy, with southern hair and eyes, and young,\\nbut like a mask of tragedy.\\n\\n     After a pause the priest spoke again in his mild manner.\\n\"Admiral,\" he said, \"will you do me a favour?  Let me, and my friends\\nif they like, stop in that tower of yours just for tonight?\\nDo you know that in my business you\\'re an exorcist almost before\\nanything else?\"\\n\\n     Pendragon sprang to his feet and paced swiftly to and fro\\nacross the window, from which the face had instantly vanished.\\n\"I tell you there is nothing in it,\" he cried, with ringing violence.\\n\"There is one thing I know about this matter.  You may call me an atheist.\\nI am an atheist.\"  Here he swung round and fixed Father Brown with a face\\nof frightful concentration.  \"This business is perfectly natural.\\nThere is no curse in it at all.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown smiled.  \"In that case,\" he said, \"there can\\'t be\\nany objection to my sleeping in your delightful summer-house.\"\\n\\n     \"The idea is utterly ridiculous,\" replied the Admiral,\\nbeating a tattoo on the back of his chair.\\n\\n     \"Please forgive me for everything,\" said Brown in his most\\nsympathetic tone, \"including spilling the wine.  But it seems to me\\nyou are not quite so easy about the flaming tower as you try to be.\"\\n\\n     Admiral Pendragon sat down again as abruptly as he had risen;\\nbut he sat quite still, and when he spoke again it was in a lower voice.\\n\"You do it at your own peril,\" he said; \"but wouldn\\'t you be an atheist\\nto keep sane in all this devilry?\"\\n\\n     Some three hours afterwards Fanshaw, Flambeau and the priest\\nwere still dawdling about the garden in the dark; and it began to dawn\\non the other two that Father Brown had no intention of going to bed\\neither in the tower or the house.\\n\\n     \"I think the lawn wants weeding,\" said he dreamily.\\n\"If I could find a spud or something I\\'d do it myself.\"\\n\\n     They followed him, laughing and half remonstrating; but he replied\\nwith the utmost solemnity, explaining to them, in a maddening little sermon,\\nthat one can always find some small occupation that is helpful to others.\\nHe did not find a spud; but he found an old broom made of twigs,\\nwith which he began energetically to brush the fallen leaves off the grass.\\n\\n     \"Always some little thing to be done,\" he said with\\nidiotic cheerfulness; \"as George Herbert says:  `Who sweeps\\nan Admiral\\'s garden in Cornwall as for Thy laws makes that and\\nthe action fine.\\' And now,\" he added, suddenly slinging the broom away,\\n\"Let\\'s go and water the flowers.\"\\n\\n     With the same mixed emotions they watched him uncoil some\\nconsiderable lengths of the large garden hose, saying with an air of\\nwistful discrimination:  \"The red tulips before the yellow, I think.\\nLook a bit dry, don\\'t you think?\"\\n\\n     He turned the little tap on the instrument, and the water shot out\\nstraight and solid as a long rod of steel.\\n\\n     \"Look out, Samson,\" cried Flambeau; \"why, you\\'ve cut off\\nthe tulip\\'s head.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown stood ruefully contemplating the decapitated plant.\\n\\n     \"Mine does seem to be a rather kill or cure sort of watering,\"\\nhe admitted, scratching his head.  \"I suppose it\\'s a pity I didn\\'t\\nfind the spud.  You should have seen me with the spud!  Talking of tools,\\nyou\\'ve got that swordstick, Flambeau, you always carry?  That\\'s right;\\nand Sir Cecil could have that sword the Admiral threw away\\nby the fence here.  How grey everything looks!\"\\n\\n     \"The mist\\'s rising from the river,\" said the staring Flambeau.\\n\\n     Almost as he spoke the huge figure of the hairy gardener appeared\\non a higher ridge of the trenched and terraced lawn, hailing them with\\na brandished rake and a horribly bellowing voice.  \"Put down that hose,\"\\nhe shouted; \"put down that hose and go to your--\"\\n\\n     \"I am fearfully clumsy,\" replied the reverend gentleman weakly;\\n\"do you know, I upset some wine at dinner.\" He made a wavering\\nhalf-turn of apology towards the gardener, with the hose still spouting\\nin his hand.  The gardener caught the cold crash of the water\\nfull in his face like the crash of a cannon-ball; staggered,\\nslipped and went sprawling with his boots in the air.\\n\\n     \"How very dreadful!\" said Father Brown, looking round in\\na sort of wonder.  \"Why, I\\'ve hit a man!\"\\n\\n     He stood with his head forward for a moment as if\\nlooking or listening; and then set off at a trot towards the tower,\\nstill trailing the hose behind him.  The tower was quite close,\\nbut its outline was curiously dim.\\n\\n     \"Your river mist,\" he said, \"has a rum smell.\"\\n\\n     \"By the Lord it has,\" cried Fanshaw, who was very white.\\n\"But you can\\'t mean--\"\\n\\n     \"I mean,\" said Father Brown, \"that one of the Admiral\\'s scientific\\npredictions is coming true tonight.  This story is going to end in smoke.\"\\n\\n     As he spoke a most beautiful rose-red light seemed to burst\\ninto blossom like a gigantic rose; but accompanied with a crackling\\nand rattling noise that was like the laughter of devils.\\n\\n     \"My God! what is this?\" cried Sir Cecil Fanshaw.\\n\\n     \"The sign of the flaming tower,\" said Father Brown, and sent\\nthe driving water from his hose into the heart of the red patch.\\n\\n     \"Lucky we hadn\\'t gone to bed!\" ejaculated Fanshaw.  \"I suppose\\nit can\\'t spread to the house.\"\\n\\n     \"You may remember,\" said the priest quietly, \"that the wooden fence\\nthat might have carried it was cut away.\"\\n\\n     Flambeau turned electrified eyes upon his friend, but Fanshaw\\nonly said rather absently:  \"Well, nobody can be killed, anyhow.\"\\n\\n     \"This is rather a curious kind of tower,\" observed Father Brown,\\n\"when it takes to killing people, it always kills people\\nwho are somewhere else.\"\\n\\n     At the same instant the monstrous figure of the gardener with\\nthe streaming beard stood again on the green ridge against the sky,\\nwaving others to come on; but now waving not a rake but a cutlass.\\nBehind him came the two negroes, also with the old crooked cutlasses\\nout of the trophy.  But in the blood-red glare, with their black faces\\nand yellow figures, they looked like devils carrying instruments of torture.\\nIn the dim garden behind them a distant voice was heard calling out\\nbrief directions.  When the priest heard the voice, a terrible change\\ncame over his countenance.\\n\\n     But he remained composed; and never took his eye off\\nthe patch of flame which had begun by spreading, but now seemed\\nto shrink a little as it hissed under the torch of the long silver spear\\nof water.  He kept his finger along the nozzle of the pipe to ensure the aim,\\nand attended to no other business, knowing only by the noise and\\nthat semi-conscious corner of the eye, the exciting incidents that\\nbegan to tumble themselves about the island garden.  He gave two brief\\ndirections to his friends.  One was:  \"Knock these fellows down somehow\\nand tie them up, whoever they are; there\\'s rope down by those faggots.\\nThey want to take away my nice hose.\" The other was:  \"As soon as you\\nget a chance, call out to that canoeing girl; she\\'s over on the bank\\nwith the gipsies.  Ask her if they could get some buckets across\\nand fill them from the river.\"  Then he closed his mouth and continued\\nto water the new red flower as ruthlessly as he had watered the red tulip.\\n\\n     He never turned his head to look at the strange fight that\\nfollowed between the foes and friends of the mysterious fire.\\nHe almost felt the island shake when Flambeau collided with\\nthe huge gardener; he merely imagined how it would whirl round them\\nas they wrestled.  He heard the crashing fall; and his friend\\'s\\ngasp of triumph as he dashed on to the first negro; and the cries\\nof both the blacks as Flambeau and Fanshaw bound them.\\nFlambeau\\'s enormous strength more than redressed the odds in the fight,\\nespecially as the fourth man still hovered near the house,\\nonly a shadow and a voice.  He heard also the water broken by\\nthe paddles of a canoe; the girl\\'s voice giving orders,\\nthe voices of gipsies answering and coming nearer, the plumping and\\nsucking noise of empty buckets plunged into a full stream; and finally\\nthe sound of many feet around the fire.  But all this was less to him\\nthan the fact that the red rent, which had lately once more increased,\\nhad once more slightly diminished.\\n\\n     Then came a cry that very nearly made him turn his head.\\nFlambeau and Fanshaw, now reinforced by some of the gipsies,\\nhad rushed after the mysterious man by the house; and he heard from\\nthe other end of the garden the Frenchman\\'s cry of horror and astonishment.\\nIt was echoed by a howl not to be called human, as the being broke\\nfrom their hold and ran along the garden.  Three times at least\\nit raced round the whole island, in a way that was as horrible as\\nthe chase of a lunatic, both in the cries of the pursued and the ropes\\ncarried by the pursuers; but was more horrible still, because it somehow\\nsuggested one of the chasing games of children in a garden.\\nThen, finding them closing in on every side, the figure sprang upon\\none of the higher river banks and disappeared with a splash\\ninto the dark and driving river.\\n\\n     \"You can do no more, I fear,\" said Brown in a voice cold with pain.\\n\"He has been washed down to the rocks by now, where he has sent\\nso many others.  He knew the use of a family legend.\"\\n\\n     \"Oh, don\\'t talk in these parables,\" cried Flambeau impatiently.\\n\"Can\\'t you put it simply in words of one syllable?\"\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" answered Brown, with his eye on the hose.  \"`Both eyes bright,\\nshe\\'s all right; one eye blinks, down she sinks.\\'\"\\n\\n     The fire hissed and shrieked more and more, like a strangled thing,\\nas it grew narrower and narrower under the flood from the pipe and buckets,\\nbut Father Brown still kept his eye on it as he went on speaking:\\n\\n     \"I thought of asking this young lady, if it were morning yet,\\nto look through that telescope at the river mouth and the river.\\nShe might have seen something to interest her:  the sign of the ship,\\nor Mr Walter Pendragon coming home, and perhaps even the sign of\\nthe half-man, for though he is certainly safe by now, he may very well\\nhave waded ashore.  He has been within a shave of another shipwreck;\\nand would never have escaped it, if the lady hadn\\'t had the sense\\nto suspect the old Admiral\\'s telegram and come down to watch him.\\nDon\\'t let\\'s talk about the old Admiral.  Don\\'t let\\'s talk about anything.\\nIt\\'s enough to say that whenever this tower, with its pitch and resin-wood,\\nreally caught fire, the spark on the horizon always looked like\\nthe twin light to the coast light-house.\"\\n\\n     \"And that,\" said Flambeau, \"is how the father and brother died.\\nThe wicked uncle of the legends very nearly got his estate after all.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown did not answer; indeed, he did not speak again,\\nsave for civilities, till they were all safe round a cigar-box in\\nthe cabin of the yacht.  He saw that the frustrated fire was extinguished;\\nand then refused to linger, though he actually heard young Pendragon,\\nescorted by an enthusiastic crowd, come tramping up the river bank;\\nand might (had he been moved by romantic curiosities) have received\\nthe combined thanks of the man from the ship and the girl from the canoe.\\nBut his fatigue had fallen on him once more, and he only started once,\\nwhen Flambeau abruptly told him he had dropped cigar-ash on his trousers.\\n\\n     \"That\\'s no cigar-ash,\" he said rather wearily.  \"That\\'s from the fire,\\nbut you don\\'t think so because you\\'re all smoking cigars.\\nThat\\'s just the way I got my first faint suspicion about the chart.\"\\n\\n     \"Do you mean Pendragon\\'s chart of his Pacific Islands?\" asked Fanshaw.\\n\\n     \"You thought it was a chart of the Pacific Islands,\" answered Brown.\\n\"Put a feather with a fossil and a bit of coral and everyone will\\nthink it\\'s a specimen.  Put the same feather with a ribbon and\\nan artificial flower and everyone will think it\\'s for a lady\\'s hat.\\nPut the same feather with an ink-bottle, a book and a stack\\nof writing-paper, and most men will swear they\\'ve seen a quill pen.\\nSo you saw that map among tropic birds and shells and thought it was\\na map of Pacific Islands.  It was the map of this river.\"\\n\\n     \"But how do you know?\" asked Fanshaw.\\n\\n     \"I saw the rock you thought was like a dragon, and the one\\nlike Merlin, and--\"\\n\\n     \"You seem to have noticed a lot as we came in,\" cried Fanshaw.\\n\"We thought you were rather abstracted.\"\\n\\n     \"I was sea-sick,\" said Father Brown simply.  \"I felt simply horrible.\\nBut feeling horrible has nothing to do with not seeing things.\"\\nAnd he closed his eyes.\\n\\n     \"Do you think most men would have seen that?\" asked Flambeau.\\nHe received no answer:  Father Brown was asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX. The God of the Gongs\\n\\n\\nIT was one of those chilly and empty afternoons in early winter,\\nwhen the daylight is silver rather than gold and pewter rather than silver.\\nIf it was dreary in a hundred bleak offices and yawning drawing-rooms,\\nit was drearier still along the edges of the flat Essex coast,\\nwhere the monotony was the more inhuman for being broken\\nat very long intervals by a lamp-post that looked less civilized\\nthan a tree, or a tree that looked more ugly than a lamp-post.\\nA light fall of snow had half-melted into a few strips, also looking leaden\\nrather than silver, when it had been fixed again by the seal of frost;\\nno fresh snow had fallen, but a ribbon of the old snow ran along\\nthe very margin of the coast, so as to parallel the pale ribbon of the foam.\\n\\n     The line of the sea looked frozen in the very vividness of\\nits violet-blue, like the vein of a frozen finger.  For miles and miles,\\nforward and back, there was no breathing soul, save two pedestrians,\\nwalking at a brisk pace, though one had much longer legs and took\\nmuch longer strides than the other.\\n\\n     It did not seem a very appropriate place or time for a holiday,\\nbut Father Brown had few holidays, and had to take them when he could,\\nand he always preferred, if possible, to take them in company with\\nhis old friend Flambeau, ex-criminal and ex-detective.  The priest had\\nhad a fancy for visiting his old parish at Cobhole, and was going\\nnorth-eastward along the coast.\\n\\n     After walking a mile or two farther, they found that the shore was\\nbeginning to be formally embanked, so as to form something like a parade;\\nthe ugly lamp-posts became less few and far between and more ornamental,\\nthough quite equally ugly.  Half a mile farther on Father Brown\\nwas puzzled first by little labyrinths of flowerless flower-pots,\\ncovered with the low, flat, quiet-coloured plants that look less like\\na garden than a tessellated pavement, between weak curly paths studded\\nwith seats with curly backs.  He faintly sniffed the atmosphere of\\na certain sort of seaside town that be did not specially care about,\\nand, looking ahead along the parade by the sea, he saw something that\\nput the matter beyond a doubt.  In the grey distance the big bandstand\\nof a watering-place stood up like a giant mushroom with six legs.\\n\\n     \"I suppose,\" said Father Brown, turning up his coat-collar\\nand drawing a woollen scarf rather closer round his neck,\\n\"that we are approaching a pleasure resort.\"\\n\\n     \"I fear,\" answered Flambeau, \"a pleasure resort to which\\nfew people just now have the pleasure of resorting.  They try to\\nrevive these places in the winter, but it never succeeds except with\\nBrighton and the old ones.  This must be Seawood, I think--\\nLord Pooley\\'s experiment; he had the Sicilian Singers down at Christmas,\\nand there\\'s talk about holding one of the great glove-fights here.\\nBut they\\'ll have to chuck the rotten place into the sea;\\nit\\'s as dreary as a lost railway-carriage.\"\\n\\n     They had come under the big bandstand, and the priest was\\nlooking up at it with a curiosity that had something rather odd about it,\\nhis head a little on one side, like a bird\\'s.  It was the conventional,\\nrather tawdry kind of erection for its purpose:  a flattened dome\\nor canopy, gilt here and there, and lifted on six slender pillars\\nof painted wood, the whole being raised about five feet above the parade\\non a round wooden platform like a drum.  But there was something\\nfantastic about the snow combined with something artificial about\\nthe gold that haunted Flambeau as well as his friend with\\nsome association he could not capture, but which he knew was at once\\nartistic and alien.\\n\\n     \"I\\'ve got it,\" he said at last.  \"It\\'s Japanese.  It\\'s like\\nthose fanciful Japanese prints, where the snow on the mountain\\nlooks like sugar, and the gilt on the pagodas is like gilt on gingerbread.\\nIt looks just like a little pagan temple.\"\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" said Father Brown.  \"Let\\'s have a look at the god.\"\\nAnd with an agility hardly to be expected of him, he hopped up\\non to the raised platform.\\n\\n     \"Oh, very well,\" said Flambeau, laughing; and the next instant\\nhis own towering figure was visible on that quaint elevation.\\n\\n     Slight as was the difference of height, it gave in those level wastes\\na sense of seeing yet farther and farther across land and sea.\\nInland the little wintry gardens faded into a confused grey copse;\\nbeyond that, in the distance, were long low barns of a lonely farmhouse,\\nand beyond that nothing but the long East Anglian plains.\\nSeawards there was no sail or sign of life save a few seagulls:\\nand even they looked like the last snowflakes, and seemed to float\\nrather than fly.\\n\\n     Flambeau turned abruptly at an exclamation behind him.\\nIt seemed to come from lower down than might have been expected,\\nand to be addressed to his heels rather than his head.  He instantly\\nheld out his hand, but he could hardly help laughing at what he saw.\\nFor some reason or other the platform had given way under Father Brown,\\nand the unfortunate little man had dropped through to the level\\nof the parade.  He was just tall enough, or short enough,\\nfor his head alone to stick out of the hole in the broken wood,\\nlooking like St John the Baptist\\'s head on a charger.  The face wore\\na disconcerted expression, as did, perhaps, that of St John the Baptist.\\n\\n     In a moment he began to laugh a little.  \"This wood must be rotten,\"\\nsaid Flambeau.  \"Though it seems odd it should bear me, and you go through\\nthe weak place.  Let me help you out.\"\\n\\n     But the little priest was looking rather curiously at the corners\\nand edges of the wood alleged to be rotten, and there was a sort of trouble\\non his brow.\\n\\n     \"Come along,\" cried Flambeau impatiently, still with his big\\nbrown hand extended.  \"Don\\'t you want to get out?\"\\n\\n     The priest was holding a splinter of the broken wood between\\nhis finger and thumb, and did not immediately reply.  At last he said\\nthoughtfully:  \"Want to get out?  Why, no.  I rather think I want\\nto get in.\" And he dived into the darkness under the wooden floor\\nso abruptly as to knock off his big curved clerical hat and leave it\\nlying on the boards above, without any clerical head in it.\\n\\n     Flambeau looked once more inland and out to sea, and once more\\ncould see nothing but seas as wintry as the snow, and snows as level\\nas the sea.\\n\\n     There came a scurrying noise behind him, and the little priest\\ncame scrambling out of the hole faster than he had fallen in.\\nHis face was no longer disconcerted, but rather resolute, and,\\nperhaps only through the reflections of the snow, a trifle paler than usual.\\n\\n\\n     \"Well?\" asked his tall friend.  \"Have you found the god\\nof the temple?\"\\n\\n     \"No,\" answered Father Brown.  \"I have found what was sometimes\\nmore important.  The Sacrifice.\"\\n\\n     \"What the devil do you mean?\" cried Flambeau, quite alarmed.\\n\\n     Father Brown did not answer.  He was staring, with a knot\\nin his forehead, at the landscape; and he suddenly pointed at it.\\n\"What\\'s that house over there?\" he asked.\\n\\n     Following his finger, Flambeau saw for the first time the corners\\nof a building nearer than the farmhouse, but screened for the most part\\nwith a fringe of trees.  It was not a large building, and stood well back\\nfrom the shore--, but a glint of ornament on it suggested that it was\\npart of the same watering-place scheme of decoration as the bandstand,\\nthe little gardens and the curly-backed iron seats.\\n\\n     Father Brown jumped off the bandstand, his friend following;\\nand as they walked in the direction indicated the trees fell away\\nto right and left, and they saw a small, rather flashy hotel,\\nsuch as is common in resorts--the hotel of the Saloon Bar rather than\\nthe Bar Parlour.  Almost the whole frontage was of gilt plaster and\\nfigured glass, and between that grey seascape and the grey,\\nwitch-like trees, its gimcrack quality had something spectral\\nin its melancholy.  They both felt vaguely that if any food or drink\\nwere offered at such a hostelry, it would be the paste-board ham\\nand empty mug of the pantomime.\\n\\n     In this, however, they were not altogether confirmed.  As they drew\\nnearer and nearer to the place they saw in front of the buffet,\\nwhich was apparently closed, one of the iron garden-seats with curly backs\\nthat had adorned the gardens, but much longer, running almost\\nthe whole length of the frontage.  Presumably, it was placed so that\\nvisitors might sit there and look at the sea, but one hardly expected\\nto find anyone doing it in such weather.\\n\\n     Nevertheless, just in front of the extreme end of the iron seat\\nstood a small round restaurant table, and on this stood\\na small bottle of Chablis and a plate of almonds and raisins.\\nBehind the table and on the seat sat a dark-haired young man,\\nbareheaded, and gazing at the sea in a state of almost\\nastonishing immobility.\\n\\n     But though he might have been a waxwork when they were within\\nfour yards of him, he jumped up like a jack-in-the-box when they\\ncame within three, and said in a deferential, though not undignified,\\nmanner:  \"Will you step inside, gentlemen?  I have no staff at present,\\nbut I can get you anything simple myself.\"\\n\\n     \"Much obliged,\" said Flambeau.  \"So you are the proprietor?\"\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" said the dark man, dropping back a little into\\nhis motionless manner.  \"My waiters are all Italians, you see,\\nand I thought it only fair they should see their countryman beat the black,\\nif he really can do it.  You know the great fight between Malvoli and\\nNigger Ned is coming off after all?\"\\n\\n     \"I\\'m afraid we can\\'t wait to trouble your hospitality seriously,\"\\nsaid Father Brown.  \"But my friend would be glad of a glass of sherry,\\nI\\'m sure, to keep out the cold and drink success to the Latin champion.\"\\n\\n     Flambeau did not understand the sherry, but he did not object to it\\nin the least.  He could only say amiably:  \"Oh, thank you very much.\"\\n\\n     \"Sherry, sir--certainly,\" said their host, turning to his hostel.\\n\"Excuse me if I detain you a few minutes.  As I told you,\\nI have no staff--\" And he went towards the black windows of\\nhis shuttered and unlighted inn.\\n\\n     \"Oh, it doesn\\'t really matter,\" began Flambeau, but the man\\nturned to reassure him.\\n\\n     \"I have the keys,\" he said.  \"I could find my way in the dark.\"\\n\\n     \"I didn\\'t mean--\" began Father Brown.\\n\\n     He was interrupted by a bellowing human voice that came\\nout of the bowels of the uninhabited hotel.  It thundered\\nsome foreign name loudly but inaudibly, and the hotel proprietor\\nmoved more sharply towards it than he had done for Flambeau\\'s sherry.\\nAs instant evidence proved, the proprietor had told, then and after,\\nnothing but the literal truth.  But both Flambeau and Father Brown\\nhave often confessed that, in all their (often outrageous) adventures,\\nnothing had so chilled their blood as that voice of an ogre,\\nsounding suddenly out of a silent and empty inn.\\n\\n     \"My cook!\" cried the proprietor hastily.  \"I had forgotten my cook.\\nHe will be starting presently.  Sherry, sir?\"\\n\\n     And, sure enough, there appeared in the doorway a big white bulk\\nwith white cap and white apron, as befits a cook, but with\\nthe needless emphasis of a black face.  Flambeau had often heard\\nthat negroes made good cooks.  But somehow something in the contrast\\nof colour and caste increased his surprise that the hotel proprietor\\nshould answer the call of the cook, and not the cook the call\\nof the proprietor.  But he reflected that head cooks are proverbially\\narrogant; and, besides, the host had come back with the sherry,\\nand that was the great thing.\\n\\n     \"I rather wonder,\" said Father Brown, \"that there are so few people\\nabout the beach, when this big fight is coming on after all.\\nWe only met one man for miles.\"\\n\\n     The hotel proprietor shrugged his shoulders.  \"They come from\\nthe other end of the town, you see--from the station, three miles from here.\\nThey are only interested in the sport, and will stop in hotels\\nfor the night only.  After all, it is hardly weather for\\nbasking on the shore.\"\\n\\n     \"Or on the seat,\" said Flambeau, and pointed to the little table.\\n\\n     \"I have to keep a look-out,\" said the man with the motionless face.\\nHe was a quiet, well-featured fellow, rather sallow; his dark clothes\\nhad nothing distinctive about them, except that his black necktie\\nwas worn rather high, like a stock, and secured by a gold pin\\nwith some grotesque head to it.  Nor was there anything notable\\nin the face, except something that was probably a mere nervous trick--\\na habit of opening one eye more narrowly than the other,\\ngiving the impression that the other was larger, or was,\\nperhaps, artificial.\\n\\n     The silence that ensued was broken by their host saying quietly:\\n\"Whereabouts did you meet the one man on your march?\"\\n\\n     \"Curiously enough,\" answered the priest, \"close by here--\\njust by that bandstand.\"\\n\\n     Flambeau, who had sat on the long iron seat to finish his sherry,\\nput it down and rose to his feet, staring at his friend in amazement.\\nHe opened his mouth to speak, and then shut it again.\\n\\n     \"Curious,\" said the dark-haired man thoughtfully.  \"What was he like?\"\\n\\n     \"It was rather dark when I saw him,\" began Father Brown,\\n\"but he was--\"\\n\\n     As has been said, the hotel-keeper can be proved to have told\\nthe precise truth.  His phrase that the cook was starting presently\\nwas fulfilled to the letter, for the cook came out, pulling his gloves on,\\neven as they spoke.\\n\\n     But he was a very different figure from the confused mass\\nof white and black that had appeared for an instant in the doorway.\\nHe was buttoned and buckled up to his bursting eyeballs in the most\\nbrilliant fashion.  A tall black hat was tilted on his broad black head--\\na hat of the sort that the French wit has compared to eight mirrors.\\nBut somehow the black man was like the black hat.  He also was black,\\nand yet his glossy skin flung back the light at eight angles or more.\\nIt is needless to say that he wore white spats and a white slip inside\\nhis waistcoat.  The red flower stood up in his buttonhole aggressively,\\nas if it had suddenly grown there.  And in the way he carried his cane\\nin one hand and his cigar in the other there was a certain attitude--\\nan attitude we must always remember when we talk of racial prejudices:\\nsomething innocent and insolent--the cake walk.\\n\\n     \"Sometimes,\" said Flambeau, looking after him, \"I\\'m not surprised\\nthat they lynch them.\"\\n\\n     \"I am never surprised,\" said Father Brown, \"at any work of hell.\\nBut as I was saying,\" he resumed, as the negro, still ostentatiously\\npulling on his yellow gloves, betook himself briskly towards\\nthe watering-place, a queer music-hall figure against that grey and\\nfrosty scene--\"as I was saying, I couldn\\'t describe the man very minutely,\\nbut he had a flourish and old-fashioned whiskers and moustachios,\\ndark or dyed, as in the pictures of foreign financiers, round his neck\\nwas wrapped a long purple scarf that thrashed out in the wind as he walked.\\nIt was fixed at the throat rather in the way that nurses\\nfix children\\'s comforters with a safety-pin.  Only this,\"\\nadded the priest, gazing placidly out to sea, \"was not a safety-pin.\"\\n\\n     The man sitting on the long iron bench was also gazing placidly\\nout to sea.  Now he was once more in repose.  Flambeau felt quite certain\\nthat one of his eyes was naturally larger than the other.\\nBoth were now well opened, and he could almost fancy the left eye\\ngrew larger as he gazed.\\n\\n     \"It was a very long gold pin, and had the carved head of a monkey\\nor some such thing,\" continued the cleric; \"and it was fixed\\nin a rather odd way--he wore pince-nez and a broad black--\"\\n\\n     The motionless man continued to gaze at the sea, and the eyes in\\nhis head might have belonged to two different men.  Then he made\\na movement of blinding swiftness.\\n\\n     Father Brown had his back to him, and in that flash might have\\nfallen dead on his face.  Flambeau had no weapon, but his large\\nbrown hands were resting on the end of the long iron seat.\\nHis shoulders abruptly altered their shape, and he heaved\\nthe whole huge thing high over his head, like a headsman\\'s axe\\nabout to fall.  The mere height of the thing, as he held it vertical,\\nlooked like a long iron ladder by which he was inviting men to climb\\ntowards the stars.  But the long shadow, in the level evening light,\\nlooked like a giant brandishing the Eiffel Tower.  It was the shock\\nof that shadow, before the shock of the iron crash, that made the stranger\\nquail and dodge, and then dart into his inn, leaving the flat and\\nshining dagger he had dropped exactly where it had fallen.\\n\\n     \"We must get away from here instantly,\" cried Flambeau,\\nflinging the huge seat away with furious indifference on the beach.\\nHe caught the little priest by the elbow and ran him down\\na grey perspective of barren back garden, at the end of which there\\nwas a closed back garden door.  Flambeau bent over it an instant\\nin violent silence, and then said:  \"The door is locked.\"\\n\\n     As he spoke a black feather from one of the ornamental firs fell,\\nbrushing the brim of his hat.  It startled him more than the small\\nand distant detonation that had come just before.  Then came another\\ndistant detonation, and the door he was trying to open shook\\nunder the bullet buried in it.  Flambeau\\'s shoulders again filled out\\nand altered suddenly.  Three hinges and a lock burst at the same instant,\\nand he went out into the empty path behind, carrying the great garden door\\nwith him, as Samson carried the gates of Gaza.\\n\\n     Then he flung the garden door over the garden wall, just as\\na third shot picked up a spurt of snow and dust behind his heel.\\nWithout ceremony he snatched up the little priest, slung him astraddle\\non his shoulders, and went racing towards Seawood as fast as\\nhis long legs could carry him.  It was not until nearly two miles\\nfarther on that he set his small companion down.  It had hardly been\\na dignified escape, in spite of the classic model of Anchises,\\nbut Father Brown\\'s face only wore a broad grin.\\n\\n     \"Well,\" said Flambeau, after an impatient silence, as they resumed\\ntheir more conventional tramp through the streets on the edge of the town,\\nwhere no outrage need be feared, \"I don\\'t know what all this means,\\nbut I take it I may trust my own eyes that you never met the man\\nyou have so accurately described.\"\\n\\n     \"I did meet him in a way,\" Brown said, biting his finger\\nrather nervously--\"I did really.  And it was too dark to see him properly,\\nbecause it was under that bandstand affair.  But I\\'m afraid I didn\\'t\\ndescribe him so very accurately after all, for his pince-nez\\nwas broken under him, and the long gold pin wasn\\'t stuck through\\nhis purple scarf but through his heart.\"\\n\\n     \"And I suppose,\" said the other in a lower voice, \"that glass-eyed guy\\nhad something to do with it.\"\\n\\n     \"I had hoped he had only a little,\" answered Brown\\nin a rather troubled voice, \"and I may have been wrong in what I did.\\nI acted on impulse.  But I fear this business has deep roots and dark.\"\\n\\n     They walked on through some streets in silence.  The yellow lamps\\nwere beginning to be lit in the cold blue twilight, and they were\\nevidently approaching the more central parts of the town.\\nHighly coloured bills announcing the glove-fight between Nigger Ned\\nand Malvoli were slapped about the walls.\\n\\n     \"Well,\" said Flambeau, \"I never murdered anyone, even in\\nmy criminal days, but I can almost sympathize with anyone doing it\\nin such a dreary place.  Of all God-forsaken dustbins of Nature,\\nI think the most heart-breaking are places like that bandstand,\\nthat were meant to be festive and are forlorn.  I can fancy a morbid man\\nfeeling he must kill his rival in the solitude and irony of such a scene.\\nI remember once taking a tramp in your glorious Surrey hills,\\nthinking of nothing but gorse and skylarks, when I came out on\\na vast circle of land, and over me lifted a vast, voiceless structure,\\ntier above tier of seats, as huge as a Roman amphitheatre and as empty\\nas a new letter-rack.  A bird sailed in heaven over it.  It was\\nthe Grand Stand at Epsom.  And I felt that no one would ever\\nbe happy there again.\"\\n\\n     \"It\\'s odd you should mention Epsom,\" said the priest.\\n\"Do you remember what was called the Sutton Mystery, because two\\nsuspected men--ice-cream men, I think--happened to live at Sutton?\\nThey were eventually released.  A man was found strangled, it was said,\\non the Downs round that part.  As a fact, I know (from an Irish policeman\\nwho is a friend of mine) that he was found close up to the Epsom\\nGrand Stand--in fact, only hidden by one of the lower doors being\\npushed back.\"\\n\\n     \"That is queer,\" assented Flambeau.  \"But it rather confirms\\nmy view that such pleasure places look awfully lonely out of season,\\nor the man wouldn\\'t have been murdered there.\"\\n\\n     \"I\\'m not so sure he--\" began Brown, and stopped.\\n\\n     \"Not so sure he was murdered?\" queried his companion.\\n\\n     \"Not so sure he was murdered out of the season,\" answered\\nthe little priest, with simplicity.  \"Don\\'t you think there\\'s something\\nrather tricky about this solitude, Flambeau?  Do you feel sure\\na wise murderer would always want the spot to be lonely?\\nIt\\'s very, very seldom a man is quite alone.  And, short of that,\\nthe more alone he is, the more certain he is to be seen.\\nNo; I think there must be some other--Why, here we are at\\nthe Pavilion or Palace, or whatever they call it.\"\\n\\n     They had emerged on a small square, brilliantly lighted,\\nof which the principal building was gay with gilding, gaudy with posters,\\nand flanked with two giant photographs of Malvoli and Nigger Ned.\\n\\n     \"Hallo!\" cried Flambeau in great surprise, as his clerical friend\\nstumped straight up the broad steps.  \"I didn\\'t know pugilism was\\nyour latest hobby.  Are you going to see the fight?\"\\n\\n     \"I don\\'t think there will be any fight,\" replied Father Brown.\\n\\n     They passed rapidly through ante-rooms and inner rooms;\\nthey passed through the hall of combat itself, raised, roped,\\nand padded with innumerable seats and boxes, and still the cleric did\\nnot look round or pause till he came to a clerk at a desk outside\\na door marked \"Committee\".  There he stopped and asked to see Lord Pooley.\\n\\n     The attendant observed that his lordship was very busy,\\nas the fight was coming on soon, but Father Brown had a good-tempered\\ntedium of reiteration for which the official mind is generally not prepared.\\nIn a few moments the rather baffled Flambeau found himself in the presence\\nof a man who was still shouting directions to another man going out of\\nthe room.  \"Be careful, you know, about the ropes after the fourth--\\nWell, and what do you want, I wonder!\"\\n\\n     Lord Pooley was a gentleman, and, like most of the few remaining\\nto our race, was worried--especially about money.  He was half grey\\nand half flaxen, and he had the eyes of fever and a high-bridged,\\nfrost-bitten nose.\\n\\n     \"Only a word,\" said Father Brown.  \"I have come to prevent\\na man being killed.\"\\n\\n     Lord Pooley bounded off his chair as if a spring had\\nflung him from it.  \"I\\'m damned if I\\'ll stand any more of this!\"\\nhe cried.  \"You and your committees and parsons and petitions!\\nWeren\\'t there parsons in the old days, when they fought without gloves?\\nNow they\\'re fighting with the regulation gloves, and there\\'s not\\nthe rag of a possibility of either of the boxers being killed.\"\\n\\n     \"I didn\\'t mean either of the boxers,\" said the little priest.\\n\\n     \"Well, well, well!\" said the nobleman, with a touch of frosty humour.\\n\"Who\\'s going to be killed?  The referee?\"\\n\\n     \"I don\\'t know who\\'s going to be killed,\" replied Father Brown,\\nwith a reflective stare.  \"If I did I shouldn\\'t have to\\nspoil your pleasure.  I could simply get him to escape.\\nI never could see anything wrong about prize-fights.  As it is,\\nI must ask you to announce that the fight is off for the present.\"\\n\\n     \"Anything else?\" jeered the gentleman with feverish eyes.\\n\"And what do you say to the two thousand people who have come to see it?\"\\n\\n     \"I say there will be one thousand nine-hundred and ninety-nine\\nof them left alive when they have seen it,\" said Father Brown.\\n\\n     Lord Pooley looked at Flambeau.  \"Is your friend mad?\" he asked.\\n\\n     \"Far from it,\" was the reply.\\n\\n     \"And took here,\" resumed Pooley in his restless way,\\n\"it\\'s worse than that.  A whole pack of Italians have turned up\\nto back Malvoli--swarthy, savage fellows of some country, anyhow.\\nYou know what these Mediterranean races are like.  If I send out word\\nthat it\\'s off we shall have Malvoli storming in here at the head of\\na whole Corsican clan.\"\\n\\n     \"My lord, it is a matter of life and death,\" said the priest.\\n\"Ring your bell.  Give your message.  And see whether it is Malvoli\\nwho answers.\"\\n\\n     The nobleman struck the bell on the table with an odd air\\nof new curiosity.  He said to the clerk who appeared almost instantly\\nin the doorway:  \"I have a serious announcement to make to the audience\\nshortly.  Meanwhile, would you kindly tell the two champions that\\nthe fight will have to be put off.\"\\n\\n     The clerk stared for some seconds as if at a demon and vanished.\\n\\n     \"What authority have you for what you say?\" asked Lord Pooley\\nabruptly.  \"Whom did you consult?\"\\n\\n     \"I consulted a bandstand,\" said Father Brown, scratching his head.\\n\"But, no, I\\'m wrong; I consulted a book, too.  I  picked it up\\non a bookstall in London--very cheap, too.\"\\n\\n     He had taken out of his pocket a small, stout, leather-bound volume,\\nand Flambeau, looking over his shoulder, could see that it was some\\nbook of old travels, and had a leaf turned down for reference.\\n\\n     \"`The only form in which Voodoo--\\'\" began Father Brown, reading aloud.\\n\\n     \"In which what?\" inquired his lordship.\\n\\n     \"`In which Voodoo,\\'\" repeated the reader, almost with relish,\\n\"`is widely organized outside Jamaica itself is in the form known as\\nthe Monkey, or the God of the Gongs, which is powerful in many parts of\\nthe two American continents, especially among half-breeds, many of whom\\nlook exactly like white men.  It differs from most other forms\\nof devil-worship and human sacrifice in the fact that the blood\\nis not shed formally on the altar, but by a sort of assassination\\namong the crowd.  The gongs beat with a deafening din as\\nthe doors of the shrine open and the monkey-god is revealed;\\nalmost the whole congregation rivet ecstatic eyes on him.  But after--\\'\"\\n\\n     The door of the room was flung open, and the fashionable negro\\nstood framed in it, his eyeballs rolling, his silk hat still insolently\\ntilted on his head.  \"Huh!\" he cried, showing his apish teeth.\\n\"What this?  Huh!  Huh!  You steal a coloured gentleman\\'s prize--\\nprize his already--yo\\' think yo\\' jes\\' save that white \\'Talian trash--\"\\n\\n     \"The matter is only deferred,\" said the nobleman quietly.\\n\"I will be with you to explain in a minute or two.\"\\n\\n     \"Who you to--\" shouted Nigger Ned, beginning to storm.\\n\\n     \"My name is Pooley,\" replied the other, with a creditable coolness.\\n\"I am the organizing secretary, and I advise you just now\\nto leave the room.\"\\n\\n     \"Who this fellow?\" demanded the dark champion, pointing to the\\npriest disdainfully.\\n\\n     \"My name is Brown,\" was the reply.  \"And I advise you just now\\nto leave the country.\"\\n\\n     The prize-fighter stood glaring for a few seconds, and then,\\nrather to the surprise of Flambeau and the others, strode out,\\nsending the door to with a crash behind him.\\n\\n     \"Well,\" asked Father Brown rubbing his dusty hair up,\\n\"what do you think of Leonardo da Vinci?  A beautiful Italian head.\"\\n\\n     \"Look here,\" said Lord Pooley, \"I\\'ve taken a considerable responsibility,\\non your bare word.  I think you ought to tell me more about this.\"\\n\\n     \"You are quite right, my lord,\" answered Brown.  \"And it won\\'t take\\nlong to tell.\" He put the little leather book in his overcoat pocket.\\n\"I think we know all that this can tell us, but you shall look at it\\nto see if I\\'m right.  That negro who has just swaggered out is one of\\nthe most dangerous men on earth, for he has the brains of a European,\\nwith the instincts of a cannibal.  He has turned what was clean,\\ncommon-sense butchery among his fellow-barbarians into a very modern\\nand scientific secret society of assassins.  He doesn\\'t know I know it,\\nnor, for the matter of that, that I can\\'t prove it.\"\\n\\n     There was a silence, and the little man went on.\\n\\n     \"But if I want to murder somebody, will it really be the best plan\\nto make sure I\\'m alone with him?\"\\n\\n     Lord Pooley\\'s eyes recovered their frosty twinkle as he\\nlooked at the little clergyman.  He only said:  \"If you want to\\nmurder somebody, I should advise it.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown shook his head, like a murderer of much riper experience.\\n\"So Flambeau said,\" he replied, with a sigh.  \"But consider.\\nThe more a man feels lonely the less he can be sure he is alone.\\nIt must mean empty spaces round him, and they are just what\\nmake him obvious.  Have you never seen one ploughman from the heights,\\nor one shepherd from the valleys? Have you never walked along a cliff,\\nand seen one man walking along the sands?  Didn\\'t you know when he\\'s\\nkilled a crab, and wouldn\\'t you have known if it had been a creditor?\\nNo! No! No!  For an intelligent murderer, such as you or I might be,\\nit is an impossible plan to make sure that nobody is looking at you.\"\\n\\n     \"But what other plan is there?\"\\n\\n     \"There is only one,\" said the priest.  \"To make sure\\nthat everybody is looking at something else.  A man is throttled\\nclose by the big stand at Epsom.  Anybody might have seen it done\\nwhile the stand stood empty--any tramp under the hedges or motorist\\namong the hills.  But nobody would have seen it when the stand\\nwas crowded and the whole ring roaring, when the favourite was\\ncoming in first--or wasn\\'t.  The twisting of a neck-cloth,\\nthe thrusting of a body behind a door could be done in an instant--\\nso long as it was that instant.  It was the same, of course,\"\\nhe continued turning to Flambeau, \"with that poor fellow\\nunder the bandstand.  He was dropped through the hole (it wasn\\'t\\nan accidental hole) just at some very dramatic moment of the entertainment,\\nwhen the bow of some great violinist or the voice of some great singer\\nopened or came to its climax.  And here, of course, when the knock-out\\nblow came--it would not be the only one.  That is the little trick\\nNigger Ned has adopted from his old God of Gongs.\"\\n\\n     \"By the way, Malvoli--\" Pooley began.\\n\\n     \"Malvoli,\" said the priest, \"has nothing to do with it.\\nI dare say he has some Italians with him, but our amiable friends\\nare not Italians.  They are octoroons and African half-bloods\\nof various shades, but I fear we English think all foreigners\\nare much the same so long as they are dark and dirty.  Also,\"\\nhe added, with a smile, \"I fear the English decline to draw\\nany fine distinction between the moral character produced by my religion\\nand that which blooms out of Voodoo.\"\\n\\n     The blaze of the spring season had burst upon Seawood,\\nlittering its foreshore with famines and bathing-machines,\\nwith nomadic preachers and nigger minstrels, before the two friends\\nsaw it again, and long before the storm of pursuit after the strange\\nsecret society had died away.  Almost on every hand the secret\\nof their purpose perished with them.  The man of the hotel was found\\ndrifting dead on the sea like so much seaweed; his right eye was\\nclosed in peace, but his left eye was wide open, and glistened like glass\\nin the moon.  Nigger Ned had been overtaken a mile or two away,\\nand murdered three policemen with his closed left hand.\\nThe remaining officer was surprised--nay, pained--and the negro got away.\\nBut this was enough to set all the English papers in a flame,\\nand for a month or two the main purpose of the British Empire was\\nto prevent the buck nigger (who was so in both senses) escaping by any\\nEnglish port.  Persons of a figure remotely reconcilable with his\\nwere subjected to quite extraordinary inquisitions, made to scrub\\ntheir faces before going on board ship, as if each white complexion\\nwere made up like a mask, of greasepaint.  Every negro in England\\nwas put under special regulations and made to report himself;\\nthe outgoing ships would no more have taken a nigger than a basilisk.\\nFor people had found out how fearful and vast and silent was\\nthe force of the savage secret society, and by the time Flambeau and\\nFather Brown were leaning on the parade parapet in April, the Black Man\\nmeant in England almost what he once meant in Scotland.\\n\\n     \"He must be still in England,\" observed Flambeau, \"and horridly\\nwell hidden, too.  They must have found him at the ports if he had\\nonly whitened his face.\"\\n\\n     \"You see, he is really a clever man,\" said Father Brown\\napologetically.  \"And I\\'m sure he wouldn\\'t whiten his face.\"\\n\\n     \"Well, but what would he do?\"\\n\\n     \"I think,\" said Father Brown, \"he would blacken his face.\"\\n\\n     Flambeau, leaning motionless on the parapet, laughed and said:\\n\"My dear fellow!\"\\n\\n     Father Brown, also leaning motionless on the parapet, moved one finger\\nfor an instant into the direction of the soot-masked niggers singing\\non the sands.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX. The Salad of Colonel Cray\\n\\n\\nFATHER BROWN was walking home from Mass on a white weird morning\\nwhen the mists were slowly lifting--one of those mornings when\\nthe very element of light appears as something mysterious and new.\\nThe scattered trees outlined themselves more and more out of the vapour,\\nas if they were first drawn in grey chalk and then in charcoal.\\nAt yet more distant intervals appeared the houses upon the broken fringe\\nof the suburb; their outlines became clearer and clearer until\\nhe recognized many in which he had chance acquaintances, and many more\\nthe names of whose owners he knew.  But all the windows and doors\\nwere sealed; none of the people were of the sort that would be up\\nat such a time, or still less on such an errand.  But as he passed under\\nthe shadow of one handsome villa with verandas and wide ornate gardens,\\nhe heard a noise that made him almost involuntarily stop.\\nIt was the unmistakable noise of a pistol or carbine or some\\nlight firearm discharged; but it was not this that puzzled him most.\\nThe first full noise was immediately followed by a series of fainter noises--\\nas he counted them, about six.  He supposed it must be the echo;\\nbut the odd thing was that the echo was not in the least like\\nthe original sound.  It was not like anything else that he could think of;\\nthe three things nearest to it seemed to be the noise made by\\nsiphons of soda-water, one of the many noises made by an animal,\\nand the noise made by a person attempting to conceal laughter.\\nNone of which seemed to make much sense.\\n\\n     Father Brown was made of two men.  There was a man of action,\\nwho was as modest as a primrose and as punctual as a clock;\\nwho went his small round of duties and never dreamed of altering it.\\nThere was also a man of reflection, who was much simpler but much stronger,\\nwho could not easily be stopped; whose thought was always (in the only\\nintelligent sense of the words) free thought.  He could not help,\\neven unconsciously, asking himself all the questions that\\nthere were to be asked, and answering as many of them as he could;\\nall that went on like his breathing or circulation.  But he never\\nconsciously carried his actions outside the sphere of his own duty;\\nand in this case the two attitudes were aptly tested.  He was just about\\nto resume his trudge in the twilight, telling himself it was no affair\\nof his, but instinctively twisting and untwisting twenty theories\\nabout what the odd noises might mean.  Then the grey sky-line\\nbrightened into silver, and in the broadening light he realized\\nthat he had been to the house which belonged to an Anglo-Indian Major\\nnamed Putnam; and that the Major had a native cook from Malta who was\\nof his communion.  He also began to remember that pistol-shots\\nare sometimes serious things; accompanied with consequences with which\\nhe was legitimately concerned.  He turned back and went in\\nat the garden gate, making for the front door.\\n\\n     Half-way down one side of the house stood out a projection\\nlike a very low shed; it was, as he afterwards discovered,\\na large dustbin.  Round the corner of this came a figure,\\nat first a mere shadow in the haze, apparently bending and peering about.\\nThen, coming nearer, it solidified into a figure that was, indeed,\\nrather unusually solid.  Major Putnam was a bald-headed, bull-necked man,\\nshort and very broad, with one of those rather apoplectic faces\\nthat are produced by a prolonged attempt to combine the oriental climate\\nwith the occidental luxuries.  But the face was a good-humoured one,\\nand even now, though evidently puzzled and inquisitive, wore a kind of\\ninnocent grin.  He had a large palm-leaf hat on the back of his head\\n(suggesting a halo that was by no means appropriate to the face),\\nbut otherwise he was clad only in a very vivid suit of striped scarlet\\nand yellow pyjamas; which, though glowing enough to behold, must have been,\\non a fresh morning, pretty chilly to wear.  He had evidently\\ncome out of his house in a hurry, and the priest was not surprised\\nwhen he called out without further ceremony:  \"Did you hear that noise?\"\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" answered Father Brown; \"I thought I had better look in,\\nin case anything was the matter.\"\\n\\n     The Major looked at him rather queerly with his good-humoured\\ngooseberry eyes.  \"What do you think the noise was?\" he asked.\\n\\n     \"It sounded like a gun or something,\" replied the other,\\nwith some hesitation; \"but it seemed to have a singular sort of echo.\"\\n\\n     The Major was still looking at him quietly, but with protruding eyes,\\nwhen the front door was flung open, releasing a flood of gaslight\\non the face of the fading mist; and another figure in pyjamas sprang\\nor tumbled out into the garden.  The figure was much longer, leaner,\\nand more athletic; the pyjamas, though equally tropical, were\\ncomparatively tasteful, being of white with a light lemon-yellow stripe.\\nThe man was haggard, but handsome, more sunburned than the other;\\nhe had an aquiline profile and rather deep-sunken eyes, and a slight air\\nof oddity arising from the combination of coal-black hair with\\na much lighter moustache.  All this Father Brown absorbed in detail\\nmore at leisure.  For the moment he only saw one thing about the man;\\nwhich was the revolver in his hand.\\n\\n     \"Cray!\" exclaimed the Major, staring at him; \"did you fire that shot?\"\\n\\n     \"Yes, I did,\" retorted the black-haired gentleman hotly;\\n\"and so would you in my place.  If you were chased everywhere\\nby devils and nearly--\"\\n\\n     The Major seemed to intervene rather hurriedly.  \"This is my friend\\nFather Brown,\" he said.  And then to Brown:  \"I don\\'t know whether\\nyou\\'ve met Colonel Cray of the Royal Artillery.\"\\n\\n     \"I have heard of him, of course,\" said the priest innocently.\\n\"Did you--did you hit anything?\"\\n\\n     \"I thought so,\" answered Cray with gravity.\\n\\n     \"Did he--\" asked Major Putnam in a lowered voice, \"did he fall\\nor cry out, or anything?\"\\n\\n     Colonel Cray was regarding his host with a strange and steady stare.\\n\"I\\'ll tell you exactly what he did,\" he said.  \"He sneezed.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown\\'s hand went half-way to his head, with the gesture\\nof a man remembering somebody\\'s name.  He knew now what it was\\nthat was neither soda-water nor the snorting of a dog.\\n\\n     \"Well,\" ejaculated the staring Major, \"I never heard before\\nthat a service revolver was a thing to be sneezed at.\"\\n\\n     \"Nor I,\" said Father Brown faintly.  \"It\\'s lucky you didn\\'t\\nturn your artillery on him or you might have given him quite a bad cold.\"\\nThen, after a bewildered pause, he said:  \"Was it a burglar?\"\\n\\n     \"Let us go inside,\" said Major Putnam, rather sharply,\\nand led the way into his house.\\n\\n     The interior exhibited a paradox often to be marked in such\\nmorning hours:  that the rooms seemed brighter than the sky outside;\\neven after the Major had turned out the one gaslight in the front hall.\\nFather Brown was surprised to see the whole dining-table set out\\nas for a festive meal, with napkins in their rings, and wine-glasses\\nof some six unnecessary shapes set beside every plate.  It was common enough,\\nat that time of the morning, to find the remains of a banquet over-night;\\nbut to find it freshly spread so early was unusual.\\n\\n     While he stood wavering in the hall Major Putnam rushed past him\\nand sent a raging eye over the whole oblong of the tablecloth.\\nAt last he spoke, spluttering:  \"All the silver gone!\" he gasped.\\n\"Fish-knives and forks gone.  Old cruet-stand gone.  Even the old silver\\ncream-jug gone.  And now, Father Brown, I am ready to answer your question\\nof whether it was a burglar.\"\\n\\n     \"They\\'re simply a blind,\" said Cray stubbornly.  \"I know better\\nthan you why people persecute this house; I know better than you why--\"\\n\\n     The Major patted him on the shoulder with a gesture almost peculiar\\nto the soothing of a sick child, and said:  \"It was a burglar.\\nObviously it was a burglar.\"\\n\\n     \"A burglar with a bad cold,\" observed Father Brown, \"that might\\nassist you to trace him in the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n     The Major shook his head in a sombre manner.  \"He must be far beyond\\ntrace now, I fear,\" he said.\\n\\n     Then, as the restless man with the revolver turned again towards\\nthe door in the garden, he added in a husky, confidential voice:\\n\"I doubt whether I should send for the police, for fear my friend here\\nhas been a little too free with his bullets, and got on the wrong side\\nof the law.  He\\'s lived in very wild places; and, to be frank with you,\\nI think he sometimes fancies things.\"\\n\\n     \"I think you once told me,\" said Brown, \"that he believes some\\nIndian secret society is pursuing him.\"\\n\\n     Major Putnam nodded, but at the same time shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"I suppose we\\'d better follow him outside,\" he said.  \"I don\\'t want\\nany more--shall we say, sneezing?\"\\n\\n     They passed out into the morning light, which was now even tinged\\nwith sunshine, and saw Colonel Cray\\'s tall figure bent almost double,\\nminutely examining the condition of gravel and grass.  While the Major\\nstrolled unobtrusively towards him, the priest took an equally\\nindolent turn, which took him round the next corner of the house\\nto within a yard or two of the projecting dustbin.\\n\\n     He stood regarding this dismal object for some minute and a half--,\\nthen he stepped towards it, lifted the lid and put his head inside.\\nDust and other discolouring matter shook upwards as he did so;\\nbut Father Brown never observed his own appearance, whatever else\\nhe observed.  He remained thus for a measurable period, as if engaged\\nin some mysterious prayers.  Then he came out again, with some ashes\\non his hair, and walked unconcernedly away.\\n\\n     By the time he came round to the garden door again he found\\na group there which seemed to roll away morbidities as the sunlight\\nhad already rolled away the mists.  It was in no way rationally reassuring;\\nit was simply broadly comic, like a cluster of Dickens\\'s characters.\\nMajor Putnam had managed to slip inside and plunge into a proper shirt and\\ntrousers, with a crimson cummerbund, and a light square jacket over all;\\nthus normally set off, his red festive face seemed bursting with\\na commonplace cordiality.  He was indeed emphatic, but then he was talking\\nto his cook--the swarthy son of Malta, whose lean, yellow and rather\\ncareworn face contrasted quaintly with his snow-white cap and costume.\\nThe cook might well be careworn, for cookery was the Major\\'s hobby.\\nHe was one of those amateurs who always know more than the professional.\\nThe only other person he even admitted to be a judge of an omelette\\nwas his friend Cray--and as Brown remembered this, he turned to look\\nfor the other officer.  In the new presence of daylight and people clothed\\nand in their right mind, the sight of him was rather a shock.\\nThe taller and more elegant man was still in his night-garb,\\nwith tousled black hair, and now crawling about the garden on his hands\\nand knees, still looking for traces of the burglar; and now and again,\\nto all appearance, striking the ground with his hand in anger at not\\nfinding him.  Seeing him thus quadrupedal in the grass, the priest\\nraised his eyebrows rather sadly; and for the first time guessed that\\n\"fancies things\" might be an euphemism.\\n\\n     The third item in the group of the cook and the epicure was also\\nknown to Father Brown; it was Audrey Watson, the Major\\'s ward\\nand housekeeper; and at this moment, to judge by her apron,\\ntucked-up sleeves and resolute manner, much more the housekeeper\\nthan the ward.\\n\\n     \"It serves you right,\" she was saying:  \"I always told you\\nnot to have that old-fashioned cruet-stand.\"\\n\\n     \"I prefer it,\" said Putnam, placably.  \"I\\'m old-fashioned myself;\\nand the things keep together.\"\\n\\n     \"And vanish together, as you see,\" she retorted.  \"Well, if you are\\nnot going to bother about the burglar, I shouldn\\'t bother about the lunch.\\nIt\\'s Sunday, and we can\\'t send for vinegar and all that in the town;\\nand you Indian gentlemen can\\'t enjoy what you call a dinner without\\na lot of hot things.  I wish to goodness now you hadn\\'t asked\\nCousin Oliver to take me to the musical service.  It isn\\'t over\\ntill half-past twelve, and the Colonel has to leave by then.\\nI don\\'t believe you men can manage alone.\"\\n\\n     \"Oh yes, we can, my dear,\" said the Major, looking at her\\nvery amiably.  \"Marco has all the sauces, and we\\'ve often\\ndone ourselves well in very rough places, as you might know by now.\\nAnd it\\'s time you had a treat, Audrey; you mustn\\'t be a housekeeper\\nevery hour of the day; and I know you want to hear the music.\"\\n\\n     \"I want to go to church,\" she said, with rather severe eyes.\\n\\n     She was one of those handsome women who will always be handsome,\\nbecause the beauty is not in an air or a tint, but in the very structure\\nof the head and features.  But though she was not yet middle-aged\\nand her auburn hair was of a Titianesque fullness in form and colour,\\nthere was a look in her mouth and around her eyes which suggested that\\nsome sorrows wasted her, as winds waste at last the edges of a Greek temple.\\nFor indeed the little domestic difficulty of which she was now speaking\\nso decisively was rather comic than tragic.  Father Brown gathered,\\nfrom the course of the conversation, that Cray, the other gourmet,\\nhad to leave before the usual lunch-time; but that Putnam, his host,\\nnot to be done out of a final feast with an old crony, had arranged\\nfor a special dejeuner to be set out and consumed in the course of\\nthe morning, while Audrey and other graver persons were at morning service.\\nShe was going there under the escort of a relative and old friend of hers,\\nDr Oliver Oman, who, though a scientific man of a somewhat bitter type,\\nwas enthusiastic for music, and would go even to church to get it.\\nThere was nothing in all this that could conceivably concern\\nthe tragedy in Miss Watson\\'s face; and by a half conscious instinct,\\nFather Brown turned again to the seeming lunatic grubbing about\\nin the grass.\\n\\n     When he strolled across to him, the black, unbrushed head was\\nlifted abruptly, as if in some surprise at his continued presence.\\nAnd indeed, Father Brown, for reasons best known to himself,\\nhad lingered much longer than politeness required; or even,\\nin the ordinary sense, permitted.\\n\\n     \"Well!\" cried Cray, with wild eyes.  \"I suppose you think I\\'m mad,\\nlike the rest?\"\\n\\n     \"I have considered the thesis,\" answered the little man, composedly.\\n\"And I incline to think you are not.\"\\n\\n     \"What do you mean?\" snapped Cray quite savagely.\\n\\n     \"Real madmen,\" explained Father Brown, \"always encourage their\\nown morbidity.  They never strive against it.  But you are trying\\nto find traces of the burglar; even when there aren\\'t any.\\nYou are struggling against it.  You want what no madman ever wants.\"\\n\\n     \"And what is that?\"\\n\\n     \"You want to be proved wrong,\" said Brown.\\n\\n     During the last words Cray had sprung or staggered to his feet\\nand was regarding the cleric with agitated eyes.  \"By hell,\\nbut that is a true word!\" he cried.  \"They are all at me here\\nthat the fellow was only after the silver--as if I shouldn\\'t be\\nonly too pleased to think so!  She\\'s been at me,\" and he tossed his tousled\\nblack head towards Audrey, but the other had no need of the direction,\\n\"she\\'s been at me today about how cruel I was to shoot a poor harmless\\nhouse-breaker, and how I have the devil in me against poor harmless natives.\\nBut I was a good-natured man once--as good-natured as Putnam.\"\\n\\n     After a pause he said:  \"Look here, I\\'ve never seen you before;\\nbut you shall judge of the whole story.  Old Putnam and I were friends\\nin the same mess; but, owing to some accidents on the Afghan border,\\nI got my command much sooner than most men; only we were both\\ninvalided home for a bit.  I was engaged to Audrey out there;\\nand we all travelled back together.  But on the journey back\\nthings happened.  Curious things.  The result of them was\\nthat Putnam wants it broken off, and even Audrey keeps it hanging on--\\nand I know what they mean.  I know what they think I am.  So do you.\\n\\n     \"Well, these are the facts.  The last day we were in\\nan Indian city I asked Putnam if I could get some Trichinopoli cigars,\\nhe directed me to a little place opposite his lodgings.\\nI have since found he was quite right; but `opposite\\' is a dangerous word\\nwhen one decent house stands opposite five or six squalid ones;\\nand I must have mistaken the door.  It opened with difficulty,\\nand then only on darkness; but as I turned back, the door behind me\\nsank back and settled into its place with a noise as of innumerable bolts.\\nThere was nothing to do but to walk forward; which I did through\\npassage after passage, pitch-dark.  Then I came to a flight of steps,\\nand then to a blind door, secured by a latch of elaborate Eastern ironwork,\\nwhich I could only trace by touch, but which I loosened at last.\\nI came out again upon gloom, which was half turned into\\na greenish twilight by a multitude of small but steady lamps below.\\nThey showed merely the feet or fringes of some huge and empty architecture.\\nJust in front of me was something that looked like a mountain.\\nI confess I nearly fell on the great stone platform on which I had emerged,\\nto realize that it was an idol.  And worst of all, an idol with\\nits back to me.\\n\\n     \"It was hardly half human, I guessed; to judge by the small squat head,\\nand still more by a thing like a tail or extra limb turned up behind\\nand pointing, like a loathsome large finger, at some symbol graven\\nin the centre of the vast stone back.  I had begun, in the dim light,\\nto guess at the hieroglyphic, not without horror, when a more horrible\\nthing happened.  A door opened silently in the temple wall\\nbehind me and a man came out, with a brown face and a black coat.\\nHe had a carved smile on his face, of copper flesh and ivory teeth;\\nbut I think the most hateful thing about him was that he was\\nin European dress.  I was prepared, I think, for shrouded priests\\nor naked fakirs.  But this seemed to say that the devilry was\\nover all the earth.  As indeed I found it to be.\\n\\n     \"`If you had only seen the Monkey\\'s Feet,\\' he said, smiling steadily,\\nand without other preface, `we should have been very gentle--\\nyou would only be tortured and die.  If you had seen the Monkey\\'s Face,\\nstill we should be very moderate, very tolerant--you would only\\nbe tortured and live.  But as you have seen the Monkey\\'s Tail,\\nwe must pronounce the worst sentence. which is--Go Free.\\'\\n\\n     \"When he said the words I heard the elaborate iron latch with\\nwhich I had struggled, automatically unlock itself:  and then,\\nfar down the dark passages I had passed, I heard the heavy street-door\\nshifting its own bolts backwards.\\n\\n     \"`It is vain to ask for mercy; you must go free,\\' said\\nthe smiling man.  `Henceforth a hair shall slay you like a sword,\\nand a breath shall bite you like an adder; weapons shall come\\nagainst you out of nowhere; and you shall die many times.\\'\\nAnd with that he was swallowed once more in the wall behind;\\nand I went out into the street.\"\\n\\n     Cray paused; and Father Brown unaffectedly sat down on the lawn\\nand began to pick daisies.\\n\\n     Then the soldier continued:  \"Putnam, of course, with his\\njolly common sense, pooh-poohed all my fears; and from that time\\ndates his doubt of my mental balance.  Well, I\\'ll simply tell you,\\nin the fewest words, the three things that have happened since;\\nand you shall judge which of us is right.\\n\\n     \"The first happened in an Indian village on the edge of the jungle,\\nbut hundreds of miles from the temple, or town, or type of tribes\\nand customs where the curse had been put on me.  I woke in black midnight,\\nand lay thinking of nothing in particular, when I felt a faint\\ntickling thing, like a thread or a hair, trailed across my throat.\\nI shrank back out of its way, and could not help thinking of the words\\nin the temple.  But when I got up and sought lights and a mirror,\\nthe line across my neck was a line of blood.\\n\\n     \"The second happened in a lodging in Port Said, later,\\non our journey home together.  It was a jumble of tavern\\nand curiosity-shop; and though there was nothing there remotely suggesting\\nthe cult of the Monkey, it is, of course, possible that some of its\\nimages or talismans were in such a place.  Its curse was there, anyhow.\\nI woke again in the dark with a sensation that could not be put\\nin colder or more literal words than that a breath bit like an adder.\\nExistence was an agony of extinction; I dashed my head against walls\\nuntil I dashed it against a window; and fell rather than jumped\\ninto the garden below.  Putnam, poor fellow, who had called the other thing\\na chance scratch, was bound to take seriously the fact of finding me\\nhalf insensible on the grass at dawn.  But I fear it was my mental state\\nhe took seriously; and not my story.\\n\\n     \"The third happened in Malta.  We were in a fortress there;\\nand as it happened our bedrooms overlooked the open sea, which almost\\ncame up to our window-sills, save for a flat white outer wall\\nas bare as the sea.  I woke up again; but it was not dark.\\nThere was a full moon, as I walked to the window; I could have seen a bird\\non the bare battlement, or a sail on the horizon.  What I did see\\nwas a sort of stick or branch circling, self-supported, in the empty sky.\\nIt flew straight in at my window and smashed the lamp beside the pillow\\nI had just quitted.  It was one of those queer-shaped war-clubs\\nsome Eastern tribes use.  But it had come from no human hand.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown threw away a daisy-chain he was making,\\nand rose with a wistful look.  \"Has Major Putnam,\" he asked,\\n\"got any Eastern curios, idols, weapons and so on, from which\\none might get a hint?\"\\n\\n     \"Plenty of those, though not much use, I fear,\" replied Cray;\\n\"but by all means come into his study.\"\\n\\n     As they entered they passed Miss Watson buttoning her gloves for church,\\nand heard the voice of Putnam downstairs still giving a lecture on cookery\\nto the cook.  In the Major\\'s study and den of curios they came suddenly\\non a third party, silk-hatted and dressed for the street, who was\\nporing over an open book on the smoking-table--a book which he dropped\\nrather guiltily, and turned.\\n\\n     Cray introduced him civilly enough, as Dr Oman, but he showed\\nsuch disfavour in his very face that Brown guessed the two men,\\nwhether Audrey knew it or not, were rivals.  Nor was the priest\\nwholly unsympathetic with the prejudice.  Dr Oman was a very well-dressed\\ngentleman indeed; well-featured, though almost dark enough for an Asiatic.\\nBut Father Brown had to tell himself sharply that one should be in charity\\neven with those who wax their pointed beards, who have small gloved hands,\\nand who speak with perfectly modulated voices.\\n\\n     Cray seemed to find something specially irritating in\\nthe small prayer-book in Oman\\'s dark-gloved hand.  \"I didn\\'t know\\nthat was in your line,\" he said rather rudely.\\n\\n     Oman laughed mildly, but without offence.  \"This is more so, I know,\"\\nhe said, laying his hand on the big book he had dropped,\\n\"a dictionary of drugs and such things.  But it\\'s rather too large\\nto take to church.\"  Then he closed the larger book, and there seemed\\nagain the faintest touch of hurry and embarrassment.\\n\\n     \"I suppose,\" said the priest, who seemed anxious to change the subject,\\n\"all these spears and things are from India?\"\\n\\n     \"From everywhere,\" answered the doctor.  \"Putnam is an old soldier,\\nand has been in Mexico and Australia, and the Cannibal Islands\\nfor all I know.\"\\n\\n     \"I hope it was not in the Cannibal Islands,\" said Brown,\\n\"that he learnt the art of cookery.\" And he ran his eyes over\\nthe stew-pots or other strange utensils on the wall.\\n\\n     At this moment the jolly subject of their conversation\\nthrust his laughing, lobsterish face into the room.  \"Come along, Cray,\"\\nhe cried.  \"Your lunch is just coming in.  And the bells are ringing\\nfor those who want to go to church.\"\\n\\n     Cray slipped upstairs to change; Dr Oman and Miss Watson betook\\nthemselves solemnly down the street, with a string of other churchgoers;\\nbut Father Brown noticed that the doctor twice looked back\\nand scrutinized the house; and even came back to the corner of the street\\nto look at it again.\\n\\n     The priest looked puzzled.  \"He can\\'t have been at the dustbin,\"\\nhe muttered.  \"Not in those clothes.  Or was he there earlier today?\"\\n\\n     Father Brown, touching other people, was as sensitive as a barometer;\\nbut today he seemed about as sensitive as a rhinoceros.  By no social law,\\nrigid or implied, could he be supposed to linger round the lunch\\nof the Anglo-Indian friends; but he lingered, covering his position\\nwith torrents of amusing but quite needless conversation.\\nHe was the more puzzling because he did not seem to want any lunch.\\nAs one after another of the most exquisitely balanced kedgerees of curries,\\naccompanied with their appropriate vintages, were laid before\\nthe other two, he only repeated that it was one of his fast-days,\\nand munched a piece of bread and sipped and then left untasted\\na tumbler of cold water.  His talk, however, was exuberant.\\n\\n     \"I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ll do for you,\" he cried--, \"I\\'ll mix you\\na salad!  I can\\'t eat it, but I\\'ll mix it like an angel!\\nYou\\'ve got a lettuce there.\"\\n\\n     \"Unfortunately it\\'s the only thing we have got,\" answered\\nthe good-humoured Major.  \"You must remember that mustard, vinegar,\\noil and so on vanished with the cruet and the burglar.\"\\n\\n     \"I know,\" replied Brown, rather vaguely.  \"That\\'s what I\\'ve always\\nbeen afraid would happen.  That\\'s why I always carry a cruet-stand\\nabout with me.  I\\'m so fond of salads.\"\\n\\n     And to the amazement of the two men he took a pepper-pot out of\\nhis waistcoat pocket and put it on the table.\\n\\n     \"I wonder why the burglar wanted mustard, too,\" he went on,\\ntaking a mustard-pot from another pocket.  \"A mustard plaster,\\nI suppose.  And vinegar\"--and producing that condiment--\\n\"haven\\'t I heard something about vinegar and brown paper?\\nAs for oil, which I think I put in my left--\"\\n\\n     His garrulity was an instant arrested; for lifting his eyes,\\nhe saw what no one else saw--the black figure of Dr Oman standing\\non the sunlit lawn and looking steadily into the room.  Before he could\\nquite recover himself Cray had cloven in.\\n\\n     \"You\\'re an astounding card,\" he said, staring.  \"I shall come\\nand hear your sermons, if they\\'re as amusing as your manners.\"\\nHis voice changed a little, and he leaned back in his chair.\\n\\n     \"Oh, there are sermons in a cruet-stand, too,\" said Father Brown,\\nquite gravely.  \"Have you heard of faith like a grain of mustard-seed;\\nor charity that anoints with oil?  And as for vinegar, can any soldiers\\nforget that solitary soldier, who, when the sun was darkened--\"\\n\\n     Colonel Cray leaned forward a little and clutched the tablecloth.\\n\\n     Father Brown, who was making the salad, tipped two spoonfuls\\nof the mustard into the tumbler of water beside him; stood up and said\\nin a new, loud and sudden voice--\"Drink that!\"\\n\\n     At the same moment the motionless doctor in the garden came running,\\nand bursting open a window cried:  \"Am I wanted?  Has he been poisoned?\"\\n\\n     \"Pretty near,\" said Brown, with the shadow of a smile; for\\nthe emetic had very suddenly taken effect.  And Cray lay in a deck-chair,\\ngasping as for life, but alive.\\n\\n     Major Putnam had sprung up, his purple face mottled.  \"A crime!\"\\nhe cried hoarsely.  \"I will go for the police!\"\\n\\n     The priest could hear him dragging down his palm-leaf hat from the peg\\nand tumbling out of the front door; he heard the garden gate slam.\\nBut he only stood looking at Cray; and after a silence said quietly:\\n\\n     \"I shall not talk to you much; but I will tell you what\\nyou want to know.  There is no curse on you.  The Temple of the Monkey\\nwas either a coincidence or a part of the trick; the trick was\\nthe trick of a white man.  There is only one weapon that will bring blood\\nwith that mere feathery touch:  a razor held by a white man.\\nThere is one way of making a common room full of invisible,\\noverpowering poison:  turning on the gas--the crime of a white man.\\nAnd there is only one kind of club that can be thrown out of a window,\\nturn in mid-air and come back to the window next to it:\\nthe Australian boomerang.  You\\'ll see some of them in the Major\\'s study.\"\\n\\n     With that he went outside and spoke for a moment to the doctor.\\nThe moment after, Audrey Watson came rushing into the house and\\nfell on her knees beside Cray\\'s chair.  He could not hear what they said\\nto each other; but their faces moved with amazement, not unhappiness.\\nThe doctor and the priest walked slowly towards the garden gate.\\n\\n     \"I suppose the Major was in love with her, too,\" he said with a sigh;\\nand when the other nodded, observed:  \"You were very generous, doctor.\\nYou did a fine thing.  But what made you suspect?\"\\n\\n     \"A very small thing,\" said Oman; \"but it kept me restless in church\\ntill I came back to see that all was well.  That book on his table\\nwas a work on poisons; and was put down open at the place where it stated\\nthat a certain Indian poison, though deadly and difficult to trace,\\nwas particularly easily reversible by the use of the commonest emetics.\\nI suppose he read that at the last moment--\"\\n\\n     \"And remembered that there were emetics in the cruet-stand,\"\\nsaid Father Brown.  \"Exactly.  He threw the cruet in the dustbin--\\nwhere I found it, along with other silver--for the sake of\\na burglary blind.  But if you look at that pepper-pot I put on the table,\\nyou\\'ll see a small hole.  That\\'s where Cray\\'s bullet struck,\\nshaking up the pepper and making the criminal sneeze.\"\\n\\n     There was a silence.  Then Dr Oman said grimly:  \"The Major is\\na long time looking for the police.\"\\n\\n     \"Or the police in looking for the Major?\" said the priest.\\n\"Well, good-bye.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI. The Strange Crime of John Boulnois\\n\\n\\nMR CALHOUN KIDD was a very young gentleman with a very old face,\\na face dried up with its own eagerness, framed in blue-black hair\\nand a black butterfly tie.  He was the emissary in England\\nof the colossal American daily called the Western Sun--\\nalso humorously described as the \"Rising Sunset\".  This was in allusion\\nto a great journalistic declaration (attributed to Mr Kidd himself)\\nthat \"he guessed the sun would rise in the west yet, if American citizens\\ndid a bit more hustling.\" Those, however, who mock American journalism\\nfrom the standpoint of somewhat mellower traditions forget\\na certain paradox which partly redeems it.  For while the journalism\\nof the States permits a pantomimic vulgarity long past anything English,\\nit also shows a real excitement about the most earnest mental problems,\\nof which English papers are innocent, or rather incapable.\\nThe Sun was full of the most solemn matters treated in the most\\nfarcical way.  William James figured there as well as \"Weary Willie,\"\\nand pragmatists alternated with pugilists in the long procession\\nof its portraits.\\n\\n     Thus, when a very unobtrusive Oxford man named John Boulnois\\nwrote in a very unreadable review called the Natural Philosophy Quarterly\\na series of articles on alleged weak points in Darwinian evolution,\\nit fluttered no corner of the English papers; though Boulnois\\'s theory\\n(which was that of a comparatively stationary universe visited occasionally\\nby convulsions of change) had some rather faddy fashionableness at Oxford,\\nand got so far as to be named \"Catastrophism\".  But many American papers\\nseized on the challenge as a great event; and the Sun threw\\nthe shadow of Mr Boulnois quite gigantically across its pages.\\nBy the paradox already noted, articles of valuable intelligence and\\nenthusiasm were presented with headlines apparently written\\nby an illiterate maniac, headlines such as \"Darwin Chews Dirt;\\nCritic Boulnois says He Jumps the Shocks\"--or \"Keep Catastrophic,\\nsays Thinker Boulnois.\" And Mr Calhoun Kidd, of the Western Sun,\\nwas bidden to take his butterfly tie and lugubrious visage down to\\nthe little house outside Oxford where Thinker Boulnois lived\\nin happy ignorance of such a title.\\n\\n     That fated philosopher had consented, in a somewhat dazed manner,\\nto receive the interviewer, and had named the hour of nine that evening.\\nThe last of a summer sunset clung about Cumnor and the low wooded hills;\\nthe romantic Yankee was both doubtful of his road and inquisitive\\nabout his surroundings; and seeing the door of a genuine feudal\\nold-country inn, The Champion Arms, standing open, he went in\\nto make inquiries.\\n\\n     In the bar parlour he rang the bell, and had to wait\\nsome little time for a reply to it.  The only other person present\\nwas a lean man with close red hair and loose, horsey-looking clothes,\\nwho was drinking very bad whisky, but smoking a very good cigar.\\nThe whisky, of course, was the choice brand of The Champion Arms;\\nthe cigar he had probably brought with him from London.\\nNothing could be more different than his cynical negligence from\\nthe dapper dryness of the young American; but something in his pencil\\nand open notebook, and perhaps in the expression of his alert blue eye,\\ncaused Kidd to guess, correctly, that he was a brother journalist.\\n\\n     \"Could you do me the favour,\" asked Kidd, with the courtesy of\\nhis nation, \"of directing me to the Grey Cottage, where Mr Boulnois lives,\\nas I understand?\"\\n\\n     \"It\\'s a few yards down the road,\" said the red-haired man,\\nremoving his cigar; \"I shall be passing it myself in a minute,\\nbut I\\'m going on to Pendragon Park to try and see the fun.\"\\n\\n     \"What is Pendragon Park?\" asked Calhoun Kidd.\\n\\n     \"Sir Claude Champion\\'s place--haven\\'t you come down for that, too?\"\\nasked the other pressman, looking up.  \"You\\'re a journalist, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n     \"I have come to see Mr Boulnois,\" said Kidd.\\n\\n     \"I\\'ve come to see Mrs Boulnois,\" replied the other.\\n\"But I shan\\'t catch her at home.\" And he laughed rather unpleasantly.\\n\\n     \"Are you interested in Catastrophism?\" asked the wondering Yankee.\\n\\n     \"I\\'m interested in catastrophes; and there are going to be some,\"\\nreplied his companion gloomily.  \"Mine\\'s a filthy trade,\\nand I never pretend it isn\\'t.\"\\n\\n     With that he spat on the floor; yet somehow in the very act and\\ninstant one could realize that the man had been brought up as a gentleman.\\n\\n     The American pressman considered him with more attention.\\nHis face was pale and dissipated, with the promise of formidable passions\\nyet to be loosed; but it was a clever and sensitive face; his clothes\\nwere coarse and careless, but he had a good seal ring on one of his long,\\nthin fingers.  His name, which came out in the course of talk,\\nwas James Dalroy; he was the son of a bankrupt Irish landlord,\\nand attached to a pink paper which he heartily despised, called\\nSmart Society, in the capacity of reporter and of something\\npainfully like a spy.\\n\\n     Smart Society, I regret to say, felt none of that interest in\\nBoulnois on Darwin which was such a credit to the head and hearts of\\nthe Western Sun.  Dalroy had come down, it seemed, to snuff up\\nthe scent of a scandal which might very well end in the Divorce Court,\\nbut which was at present hovering between Grey Cottage and Pendragon Park.\\n\\n     Sir Claude Champion was known to the readers of the Western Sun\\nas well as Mr Boulnois.  So were the Pope and the Derby Winner;\\nbut the idea of their intimate acquaintanceship would have struck Kidd\\nas equally incongruous.  He had heard of (and written about,\\nnay, falsely pretended to know) Sir Claude Champion, as\\n\"one of the brightest and wealthiest of England\\'s Upper Ten\";\\nas the great sportsman who raced yachts round the world;\\nas the great traveller who wrote books about the Himalayas,\\nas the politician who swept constituencies with a startling sort of\\nTory Democracy, and as the great dabbler in art, music, literature,\\nand, above all, acting.  Sir Claude was really rather magnificent in\\nother than American eyes.  There was something of the Renascence Prince\\nabout his omnivorous culture and restless publicity--, he was not only\\na great amateur, but an ardent one.  There was in him none of that\\nantiquarian frivolity that we convey by the word \"dilettante\".\\n\\n     That faultless falcon profile with purple-black Italian eye,\\nwhich had been snap-shotted so often both for Smart Society and\\nthe Western Sun, gave everyone the impression of a man eaten by ambition\\nas by a fire, or even a disease.  But though Kidd knew a great deal\\nabout Sir Claude--a great deal more, in fact, than there was to know--\\nit would never have crossed his wildest dreams to connect so showy\\nan aristocrat with the newly-unearthed founder of Catastrophism,\\nor to guess that Sir Claude Champion and John Boulnois could be\\nintimate friends.  Such, according to Dalroy\\'s account,\\nwas nevertheless the fact.  The two had hunted in couples at school\\nand college, and, though their social destinies had been very different\\n(for Champion was a great landlord and almost a millionaire,\\nwhile Boulnois was a poor scholar and, until just lately,\\nan unknown one), they still kept in very close touch with each other.\\nIndeed, Boulnois\\'s cottage stood just outside the gates of Pendragon Park.\\n\\n     But whether the two men could be friends much longer was becoming\\na dark and ugly question.  A year or two before, Boulnois had married\\na beautiful and not unsuccessful actress, to whom he was devoted\\nin his own shy and ponderous style; and the proximity of the household\\nto Champion\\'s had given that flighty celebrity opportunities for behaving\\nin a way that could not but cause painful and rather base excitement.\\nSir Claude had carried the arts of publicity to perfection;\\nand he seemed to take a crazy pleasure in being equally ostentatious\\nin an intrigue that could do him no sort of honour.  Footmen from\\nPendragon were perpetually leaving bouquets for Mrs Boulnois;\\ncarriages and motor-cars were perpetually calling at the cottage\\nfor Mrs Boulnois; balls and masquerades perpetually filled the grounds\\nin which the baronet paraded Mrs Boulnois, like the Queen of\\nLove and Beauty at a tournament.  That very evening, marked by Mr\\nKidd for the exposition of Catastrophism, had been marked by\\nSir Claude Champion for an open-air rendering of Romeo and Juliet,\\nin which he was to play Romeo to a Juliet it was needless to name.\\n\\n     \"I don\\'t think it can go on without a smash,\" said the young man\\nwith red hair, getting up and shaking himself.  \"Old Boulnois may be\\nsquared--or he may be square.  But if he\\'s square he\\'s thick--\\nwhat you might call cubic.  But I don\\'t believe it\\'s possible.\"\\n\\n     \"He is a man of grand intellectual powers,\" said Calhoun Kidd\\nin a deep voice.\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" answered Dalroy; \"but even a man of grand intellectual powers\\ncan\\'t be such a blighted fool as all that.  Must you be going on?\\nI shall be following myself in a minute or two.\"\\n\\n     But Calhoun Kidd, having finished a milk and soda, betook himself\\nsmartly up the road towards the Grey Cottage, leaving his cynical informant\\nto his whisky and tobacco.  The last of the daylight had faded;\\nthe skies were of a dark, green-grey, like slate, studded here and there\\nwith a star, but lighter on the left side of the sky, with the promise\\nof a rising moon.\\n\\n     The Grey Cottage, which stood entrenched, as it were, in a square\\nof stiff, high thorn-hedges, was so close under the pines and palisades\\nof the Park that Kidd at first mistook it for the Park Lodge.\\nFinding the name on the narrow wooden gate, however, and seeing\\nby his watch that the hour of the \"Thinker\\'s\" appointment had just struck,\\nhe went in and knocked at the front door.  Inside the garden hedge,\\nhe could see that the house, though unpretentious enough, was larger\\nand more luxurious than it looked at first, and was quite a different kind\\nof place from a porter\\'s lodge.  A dog-kennel and a beehive stood outside,\\nlike symbols of old English country-life; the moon was rising behind\\na plantation of prosperous pear trees, the dog that came out of the kennel\\nwas reverend-looking and reluctant to bark; and the plain, elderly\\nman-servant who opened the door was brief but dignified.\\n\\n     \"Mr Boulnois asked me to offer his apologies, sir,\" he said,\\n\"but he has been obliged to go out suddenly.\"\\n\\n     \"But see here, I had an appointment,\" said the interviewer,\\nwith a rising voice.  \"Do you know where he went to?\"\\n\\n     \"To Pendragon Park, sir,\" said the servant, rather sombrely,\\nand began to close the door.\\n\\n     Kidd started a little.\\n\\n     \"Did he go with Mrs--with the rest of the party?\" he asked\\nrather vaguely.\\n\\n     \"No, sir,\" said the man shortly; \"he stayed behind, and then\\nwent out alone.\" And he shut the door, brutally, but with an air of\\nduty not done.\\n\\n     The American, that curious compound of impudence and sensitiveness,\\nwas annoyed.  He felt a strong desire to hustle them all along a bit\\nand teach them business habits; the hoary old dog and the grizzled,\\nheavy-faced old butler with his prehistoric shirt-front, and the drowsy\\nold moon, and above all the scatter-brained old philosopher who\\ncouldn\\'t keep an appointment.\\n\\n     \"If that\\'s the way he goes on he deserves to lose his wife\\'s\\npurest devotion,\" said Mr Calhoun Kidd.  \"But perhaps he\\'s gone over\\nto make a row.  In that case I reckon a man from the Western Sun\\nwill be on the spot.\"\\n\\n     And turning the corner by the open lodge-gates, he set off,\\nstumping up the long avenue of black pine-woods that pointed\\nin abrupt perspective towards the inner gardens of Pendragon Park.\\nThe trees were as black and orderly as plumes upon a hearse;\\nthere were still a few stars.  He was a man with more literary\\nthan direct natural associations; the word \"Ravenswood\" came into\\nhis head repeatedly.  It was partly the raven colour of the pine-woods;\\nbut partly also an indescribable atmosphere almost described\\nin Scott\\'s great tragedy; the smell of something that died\\nin the eighteenth century; the smell of dank gardens and broken urns,\\nof wrongs that will never now be righted; of something that is\\nnone the less incurably sad because it is strangely unreal.\\n\\n     More than once, as he went up that strange, black road\\nof tragic artifice, he stopped, startled, thinking he heard steps\\nin front of him.  He could see nothing in front but the twin sombre\\nwalls of pine and the wedge of starlit sky above them.  At first\\nhe thought he must have fancied it or been mocked by a mere echo of\\nhis own tramp.  But as he went on he was more and more inclined\\nto conclude, with the remains of his reason, that there really were\\nother feet upon the road.  He thought hazily of ghosts; and was surprised\\nhow swiftly he could see the image of an appropriate and local ghost,\\none with a face as white as Pierrot\\'s, but patched with black.\\nThe apex of the triangle of dark-blue sky was growing brighter and bluer,\\nbut he did not realize as yet that this was because he was coming\\nnearer to the lights of the great house and garden.  He only felt\\nthat the atmosphere was growing more intense, there was in the sadness\\nmore violence and secrecy--more--he hesitated for the word,\\nand then said it with a jerk of laughter--Catastrophism.\\n\\n     More pines, more pathway slid past him, and then he stood rooted\\nas by a blast of magic.  It is vain to say that he felt as if he had\\ngot into a dream; but this time he felt quite certain that he had\\ngot into a book.  For we human beings are used to inappropriate things;\\nwe are accustomed to the clatter of the incongruous; it is a tune\\nto which we can go to sleep.  If one appropriate thing happens,\\nit wakes us up like the pang of a perfect chord.  Something happened\\nsuch as would have happened in such a place in a forgotten tale.\\n\\n     Over the black pine-wood came flying and flashing in the moon\\na naked sword--such a slender and sparkling rapier as may have\\nfought many an unjust duel in that ancient park.  It fell on the pathway\\nfar in front of him and lay there glistening like a large needle.\\nHe ran like a hare and bent to look at it.  Seen at close quarters\\nit had rather a showy look:  the big red jewels in the hilt and guard\\nwere a little dubious.  But there were other red drops upon the blade\\nwhich were not dubious.\\n\\n     He looked round wildly in the direction from which the dazzling missile\\nhad come, and saw that at this point the sable facade of fir and pine\\nwas interrupted by a smaller road at right angles; which, when he turned it,\\nbrought him in full view of the long, lighted house, with a lake and\\nfountains in front of it.  Nevertheless, he did not look at this,\\nhaving something more interesting to look at.\\n\\n     Above him, at the angle of the steep green bank of the\\nterraced garden, was one of those small picturesque surprises\\ncommon in the old landscape gardening; a kind of small round hill or\\ndome of grass, like a giant mole-hill, ringed and crowned with\\nthree concentric fences of roses, and having a sundial in the highest point\\nin the centre.  Kidd could see the finger of the dial stand up dark\\nagainst the sky like the dorsal fin of a shark and the vain moonlight\\nclinging to that idle clock.  But he saw something else clinging\\nto it also, for one wild moment--the figure of a man.\\n\\n     Though he saw it there only for a moment, though it was outlandish\\nand incredible in costume, being clad from neck to heel in tight crimson,\\nwith glints of gold, yet he knew in one flash of moonlight who it was.\\nThat white face flung up to heaven, clean-shaven and so unnaturally young,\\nlike Byron with a Roman nose, those black curls already grizzled--\\nhe had seen the thousand public portraits of Sir Claude Champion.\\nThe wild red figure reeled an instant against the sundial; the next\\nit had rolled down the steep bank and lay at the American\\'s feet,\\nfaintly moving one arm.  A gaudy, unnatural gold ornament on the arm\\nsuddenly reminded Kidd of Romeo and Juliet; of course the tight crimson\\nsuit was part of the play.  But there was a long red stain down\\nthe bank from which the man had rolled--that was no part of the play.\\nHe had been run through the body.\\n\\n     Mr Calhoun Kidd shouted and shouted again.  Once more he seemed\\nto hear phantasmal footsteps, and started to find another figure\\nalready near him.  He knew the figure, and yet it terrified him.\\nThe dissipated youth who had called himself Dalroy had a horribly quiet\\nway with him; if Boulnois failed to keep appointments that had been made,\\nDalroy had a sinister air of keeping appointments that hadn\\'t.\\nThe moonlight discoloured everything, against Dalroy\\'s red hair\\nhis wan face looked not so much white as pale green.\\n\\n     All this morbid impressionism must be Kidd\\'s excuse for having\\ncried out, brutally and beyond all reason:  \"Did you do this, you devil?\"\\n\\n     James Dalroy smiled his unpleasing smile; but before he could speak,\\nthe fallen figure made another movement of the arm, waving vaguely\\ntowards the place where the sword fell; then came a moan, and then\\nit managed to speak.\\n\\n     \"Boulnois....  Boulnois, I say....  Boulnois did it...\\njealous of me...he was jealous, he was, he was...\"\\n\\n     Kidd bent his head down to hear more, and just managed\\nto catch the words:\\n\\n     \"Boulnois...with my own sword...he threw it...\"\\n\\n     Again the failing hand waved towards the sword, and then fell rigid\\nwith a thud.  In Kidd rose from its depth all that acrid humour\\nthat is the strange salt of the seriousness of his race.\\n\\n     \"See here,\" he said sharply and with command, \"you must\\nfetch a doctor.  This man\\'s dead.\"\\n\\n     \"And a priest, too, I suppose,\" said Dalroy in an undecipherable manner.\\n\"All these Champions are papists.\"\\n\\n     The American knelt down by the body, felt the heart, propped up\\nthe head and used some last efforts at restoration; but before\\nthe other journalist reappeared, followed by a doctor and a priest,\\nhe was already prepared to assert they were too late.\\n\\n     \"Were you too late also?\" asked the doctor, a solid\\nprosperous-looking man, with conventional moustache and whiskers,\\nbut a lively eye, which darted over Kidd dubiously.\\n\\n     \"In one sense,\" drawled the representative of the Sun.\\n\"I was too late to save the man, but I guess I was in time to hear\\nsomething of importance.  I heard the dead man denounce his assassin.\"\\n\\n     \"And who was the assassin?\" asked the doctor, drawing his\\neyebrows together.\\n\\n     \"Boulnois,\" said Calhoun Kidd, and whistled softly.\\n\\n     The doctor stared at him gloomily with a reddening brow--,\\nbut he did not contradict.  Then the priest, a shorter figure\\nin the background, said mildly:  \"I understood that Mr Boulnois\\nwas not coming to Pendragon Park this evening.\"\\n\\n     \"There again,\" said the Yankee grimly, \"I may be in a position\\nto give the old country a fact or two.  Yes, sir, John Boulnois\\nwas going to stay in all this evening; he fixed up a real good appointment\\nthere with me.  But John Boulnois changed his mind; John Boulnois\\nleft his home abruptly and all alone, and came over to this darned Park\\nan hour or so ago.  His butler told me so.  I think we hold what\\nthe all-wise police call a clue--have you sent for them?\"\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"but we haven\\'t alarmed anyone else yet.\"\\n\\n     \"Does Mrs Boulnois know?\" asked James Dalroy, and again Kidd\\nwas conscious of an irrational desire to hit him on his curling mouth.\\n\\n     \"I have not told her,\" said the doctor gruffly--, \"but here come\\nthe police.\"\\n\\n     The little priest had stepped out into the main avenue,\\nand now returned with the fallen sword, which looked ludicrously large\\nand theatrical when attached to his dumpy figure, at once clerical\\nand commonplace.  \"Just before the police come,\" he said apologetically,\\n\"has anyone got a light?\"\\n\\n     The Yankee journalist took an electric torch from his pocket,\\nand the priest held it close to the middle part of the blade,\\nwhich he examined with blinking care.  Then, without glancing at\\nthe point or pommel, he handed the long weapon to the doctor.\\n\\n     \"I fear I\\'m no use here,\" he said, with a brief sigh.\\n\"I\\'ll say good night to you, gentlemen.\" And he walked away\\nup the dark avenue towards the house, his hands clasped behind him\\nand his big head bent in cogitation.\\n\\n     The rest of the group made increased haste towards the lodge-gates,\\nwhere an inspector and two constables could already be seen\\nin consultation with the lodge-keeper.  But the little priest\\nonly walked slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine, and at last\\nstopped dead, on the steps of the house.  It was his silent way\\nof acknowledging an equally silent approach; for there came towards\\nhim a presence that might have satisfied even Calhoun Kidd\\'s demands\\nfor a lovely and aristocratic ghost.  It was a young woman\\nin silvery satins of a Renascence design; she had golden hair\\nin two long shining ropes, and a face so startingly pale between them\\nthat she might have been chryselephantine--made, that is, like some\\nold Greek statues, out of ivory and gold.  But her eyes were very bright,\\nand her voice, though low, was confident.\\n\\n     \"Father Brown?\" she said.\\n\\n     \"Mrs Boulnois?\" he replied gravely.  Then he looked at her and\\nimmediately said:  \"I see you know about Sir Claude.\"\\n\\n     \"How do you know I know?\" she asked steadily.\\n\\n     He did not answer the question, but asked another:  \"Have you\\nseen your husband?\"\\n\\n     \"My husband is at home,\" she said.  \"He has nothing to do with this.\"\\n\\n     Again he did not answer; and the woman drew nearer to him,\\nwith a curiously intense expression on her face.\\n\\n     \"Shall I tell you something more?\" she said, with a rather\\nfearful smile.  \"I don\\'t think he did it, and you don\\'t either.\"\\nFather Brown returned her gaze with a long, grave stare, and then nodded,\\nyet more gravely.\\n\\n     \"Father Brown,\" said the lady, \"I am going to tell you all I know,\\nbut I want you to do me a favour first.  Will you tell me why\\nyou haven\\'t jumped to the conclusion of poor John\\'s guilt,\\nas all the rest have done?   Don\\'t mind what you say:  I--I know about\\nthe gossip and the appearances that are against me.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown looked honestly embarrassed, and passed his hand\\nacross his forehead.  \"Two very little things,\" he said.\\n\"At least, one\\'s very trivial and the other very vague.\\nBut such as they are, they don\\'t fit in with Mr Boulnois\\nbeing the murderer.\"\\n\\n     He turned his blank, round face up to the stars and\\ncontinued absentmindedly:  \"To take the vague idea first.\\nI attach a good deal of importance to vague ideas.  All those things that\\n`aren\\'t evidence\\' are what convince me.  I think a moral impossibility\\nthe biggest of all impossibilities.  I know your husband only slightly,\\nbut I think this crime of his, as generally conceived, something\\nvery like a moral impossibility.  Please do not think I mean that\\nBoulnois could not be so wicked.  Anybody can be wicked--as wicked as\\nhe chooses.  We can direct our moral wills; but we can\\'t generally change\\nour instinctive tastes and ways of doing things.  Boulnois might\\ncommit a murder, but not this murder.  He would not snatch Romeo\\'s sword\\nfrom its romantic scabbard; or slay his foe on the sundial as on\\na kind of altar; or leave his body among the roses, or fling the sword\\naway among the pines.  If Boulnois killed anyone he\\'d do it\\nquietly and heavily, as he\\'d do any other doubtful thing--\\ntake a tenth glass of port, or read a loose Greek poet.\\nNo, the romantic setting is not like Boulnois.  It\\'s more like Champion.\"\\n\\n     \"Ah!\" she said, and looked at him with eyes like diamonds.\\n\\n     \"And the trivial thing was this,\" said Brown.  \"There were\\nfinger-prints on that sword; finger-prints can be detected quite\\na time after they are made if they\\'re on some polished surface\\nlike glass or steel.  These were on a polished surface.\\nThey were half-way down the blade of the sword.  Whose prints they were\\nI have no earthly clue; but why should anybody hold a sword half-way down?\\nIt was a long sword, but length is an advantage in lunging at an enemy.\\nAt least, at most enemies.  At all enemies except one.\"\\n\\n     \"Except one,\" she repeated.\\n\\n     \"There is only one enemy,\" said Father Brown, \"whom it is easier\\nto kill with a dagger than a sword.\"\\n\\n     \"I know,\" said the woman.  \"Oneself.\"\\n\\n     There was a long silence, and then the priest said quietly\\nbut abruptly:  \"Am I right, then?  Did Sir Claude kill himself?\"\\n\\n     \"Yes\" she said, with a face like marble.  \"I saw him do it.\"\\n\\n     \"He died,\" said Father Brown, \"for love of you?\"\\n\\n     An extraordinary expression flashed across her face,\\nvery different from pity, modesty, remorse, or anything her companion\\nhad expected:  her voice became suddenly strong and full.\\n\"I don\\'t believe,\" she said, \"he ever cared about me a rap.\\nHe hated my husband.\"\\n\\n     \"Why?\" asked the other, and turned his round face from the sky\\nto the lady.\\n\\n     \"He hated my husband because...it is so strange I hardly know\\nhow to say it...because...\"\\n\\n     \"Yes?\" said Brown patiently.\\n\\n     \"Because my husband wouldn\\'t hate him.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown only nodded, and seemed still to be listening;\\nhe differed from most detectives in fact and fiction in a small point--\\nhe never pretended not to understand when he understood perfectly well.\\n\\n     Mrs Boulnois drew near once more with the same contained\\nglow of certainty.  \"My husband,\" she said, \"is a great man.\\nSir Claude Champion was not a great man:  he was a celebrated and\\nsuccessful man.  My husband has never been celebrated or successful;\\nand it is the solemn truth that he has never dreamed of being so.\\nHe no more expects to be famous for thinking than for smoking cigars.\\nOn all that side he has a sort of splendid stupidity.  He has never\\ngrown up.  He still liked Champion exactly as he liked him at school;\\nhe admired him as he would admire a conjuring trick done at\\nthe dinner-table. But he couldn\\'t be got to conceive the notion of\\nenvying Champion.  And Champion wanted to be envied.  He went mad\\nand killed himself for that.\"\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" said Father Brown; \"I think I begin to understand.\"\\n\\n     \"Oh, don\\'t you see?\" she cried; \"the whole picture is made for that--\\nthe place is planned for it.  Champion put John in a little house\\nat his very door, like a dependant--to make him feel a failure.\\nHe never felt it.  He thinks no more about such things than--\\nthan an absent-minded lion.  Champion would burst in on John\\'s\\nshabbiest hours or homeliest meals with some dazzling present or\\nannouncement or expedition that made it like the visit of Haroun Alraschid,\\nand John would accept or refuse amiably with one eye off, so to speak,\\nlike one lazy schoolboy agreeing or disagreeing with another.\\nAfter five years of it John had not turned a hair; and Sir Claude Champion\\nwas a monomaniac.\"\\n\\n     \"And Haman began to tell them,\" said Father Brown,\\n\"of all the things wherein the king had honoured him; and he said:\\n`All these things profit me nothing while I see Mordecai the Jew\\nsitting in the gate.\\'\"\\n\\n     \"The crisis came,\" Mrs Boulnois continued, \"when I persuaded John\\nto let me take down some of his speculations and send them to a magazine.\\nThey began to attract attention, especially in America, and one paper\\nwanted to interview him. When Champion (who was interviewed\\nnearly every day) heard of this late little crumb of success\\nfalling to his unconscious rival, the last link snapped that held back\\nhis devilish hatred. Then he began to lay that insane siege to my own\\nlove and honour which has been the talk of the shire.  You will ask me\\nwhy I allowed such atrocious attentions.  I answer that I could not have\\ndeclined them except by explaining to my husband, and there are\\nsome things the soul cannot do, as the body cannot fly.\\nNobody could have explained to my husband.  Nobody could do it now.\\nIf you said to him in so many words, `Champion is stealing your wife,\\'\\nhe would think the joke a little vulgar:  that it could be anything\\nbut a joke--that notion could find no crack in his great skull\\nto get in by.  Well, John was to come and see us act this evening,\\nbut just as we were starting he said he wouldn\\'t; he had got\\nan interesting book and a cigar.  I told this to Sir Claude,\\nand it was his death-blow.  The monomaniac suddenly saw despair.\\nHe stabbed himself, crying out like a devil that Boulnois was slaying him;\\nhe lies there in the garden dead of his own jealousy to produce jealousy,\\nand John is sitting in the dining-room reading a book.\"\\n\\n     There was another silence, and then the little priest said:\\n\"There is only one weak point, Mrs Boulnois, in all your\\nvery vivid account.  Your husband is not sitting in the dining-room\\nreading a book.  That American reporter told me he had been to your house,\\nand your butler told him Mr Boulnois had gone to Pendragon Park after all.\"\\n\\n     Her bright eyes widened to an almost electric glare;\\nand yet it seemed rather bewilderment than confusion or fear.\\n\"Why, what can you mean?\" she cried.  \"All the servants were\\nout of the house, seeing the theatricals.  And we don\\'t keep a butler,\\nthank goodness!\"\\n\\n     Father Brown started and spun half round like an absurd teetotum.\\n\"What, what?\" he cried seeming galvanized into sudden life.\\n\"Look here--I say--can I make your husband hear if I go to the house?\"\\n\\n     \"Oh, the servants will be back by now,\" she said, wondering.\\n\\n     \"Right, right!\" rejoined the cleric energetically, and set off\\nscuttling up the path towards the Park gates.  He turned once to say:\\n\"Better get hold of that Yankee, or `Crime of John Boulnois\\' will be\\nall over the Republic in large letters.\"\\n\\n     \"You don\\'t understand,\" said Mrs Boulnois.  \"He wouldn\\'t mind.\\nI don\\'t think he imagines that America really is a place.\"\\n\\n     When Father Brown reached the house with the beehive and\\nthe drowsy dog, a small and neat maid-servant showed him into\\nthe dining-room, where Boulnois sat reading by a shaded lamp,\\nexactly as his wife described him.  A decanter of port and a wineglass\\nwere at his elbow; and the instant the priest entered he noted\\nthe long ash stand out unbroken on his cigar.\\n\\n     \"He has been here for half an hour at least,\" thought Father Brown.\\nIn fact, he had the air of sitting where he had sat when his dinner\\nwas cleared away.\\n\\n     \"Don\\'t get up, Mr Boulnois,\" said the priest in his pleasant,\\nprosaic way.  \"I shan\\'t interrupt you a moment.  I fear I break in on\\nsome of your scientific studies.\"\\n\\n     \"No,\" said Boulnois; \"I was reading `The Bloody Thumb.\\'\"\\nHe said it with neither frown nor smile, and his visitor was conscious\\nof a certain deep and virile indifference in the man which his wife\\nhad called greatness.  He laid down a gory yellow \"shocker\"\\nwithout even feeling its incongruity enough to comment on it humorously.\\nJohn Boulnois was a big, slow-moving man with a massive head,\\npartly grey and partly bald, and blunt, burly features.\\nHe was in shabby and very old-fashioned evening-dress, with a narrow\\ntriangular opening of shirt-front:  he had assumed it that evening\\nin his original purpose of going to see his wife act Juliet.\\n\\n     \"I won\\'t keep you long from `The Bloody Thumb\\' or any other\\ncatastrophic affairs,\" said Father Brown, smiling.  \"I only came\\nto ask you about the crime you committed this evening.\"\\n\\n     Boulnois looked at him steadily, but a red bar began to show\\nacross his broad brow; and he seemed like one discovering embarrassment\\nfor the first time.\\n\\n     \"I know it was a strange crime,\" assented Brown in a low voice.\\n\"Stranger than murder perhaps--to you.  The little sins are sometimes\\nharder to confess than the big ones--but that\\'s why it\\'s so important\\nto confess them.  Your crime is committed by every fashionable hostess\\nsix times a week:  and yet you find it sticks to your tongue like\\na nameless atrocity.\"\\n\\n     \"It makes one feel,\" said the philosopher slowly, \"such a\\ndamned fool.\"\\n\\n     \"I know,\" assented the other, \"but one often has to choose\\nbetween feeling a damned fool and being one.\"\\n\\n     \"I can\\'t analyse myself well,\" went on Boulnois; \"but sitting\\nin that chair with that story I was as happy as a schoolboy\\non a half-holiday.  It was security, eternity--I can\\'t convey it...\\nthe cigars were within reach...the matches were within reach...\\nthe Thumb had four more appearances to...it was not only a peace,\\nbut a plenitude.  Then that bell rang, and I thought for one long,\\nmortal minute that I couldn\\'t get out of that chair--literally,\\nphysically, muscularly couldn\\'t.  Then I did it like a man\\nlifting the world, because I knew all the servants were out.\\nI opened the front door, and there was a little man with his mouth open\\nto speak and his notebook open to write in.  I remembered the Yankee\\ninterviewer I had forgotten.  His hair was parted in the middle,\\nand I tell you that murder--\"\\n\\n     \"I understand,\" said Father Brown.  \"I\\'ve seen him.\"\\n\\n     \"I didn\\'t commit murder,\" continued the Catastrophist mildly,\\n\"but only perjury.  I said I had gone across to Pendragon Park\\nand shut the door in his face.  That is my crime, Father Brown,\\nand I don\\'t know what penance you would inflict for it.\"\\n\\n     \"I shan\\'t inflict any penance,\" said the clerical gentleman,\\ncollecting his heavy hat and umbrella with an air of some amusement;\\n\"quite the contrary.  I came here specially to let you off the little\\npenance which would otherwise have followed your little offence.\"\\n\\n     \"And what,\" asked Boulnois, smiling, \"is the little penance\\nI have so luckily been let off?\"\\n\\n     \"Being hanged,\" said Father Brown.\\n\\n\\n\\nXII. The Fairy Tale of Father Brown\\n\\n\\nTHE picturesque city and state of Heiligwaldenstein was one of those\\ntoy kingdoms of which certain parts of the German Empire still consist.\\nIt had come under the Prussian hegemony quite late in history--\\nhardly fifty years before the fine summer day when Flambeau and\\nFather Brown found themselves sitting in its gardens and drinking its beer.\\nThere had been not a little of war and wild justice there within\\nliving memory, as soon will be shown.  But in merely looking at it\\none could not dismiss that impression of childishness which is\\nthe most charming side of Germany--those little pantomime,\\npaternal monarchies in which a king seems as domestic as a cook.\\nThe German soldiers by the innumerable sentry-boxes looked strangely like\\nGerman toys, and the clean-cut battlements of the castle,\\ngilded by the sunshine, looked the more like the gilt gingerbread.\\nFor it was brilliant weather.  The sky was as Prussian a blue as\\nPotsdam itself could require, but it was yet more like that lavish and\\nglowing use of the colour which a child extracts from a shilling paint-box.\\nEven the grey-ribbed trees looked young, for the pointed buds on them\\nwere still pink, and in a pattern against the strong blue looked like\\ninnumerable childish figures.\\n\\n     Despite his prosaic appearance and generally practical walk of life,\\nFather Brown was not without a certain streak of romance in his composition,\\nthough he generally kept his daydreams to himself, as many children do.\\nAmid the brisk, bright colours of such a day, and in the heraldic\\nframework of such a town, he did feel rather as if he had entered\\na fairy tale.  He took a childish pleasure, as a younger brother might,\\nin the formidable sword-stick which Flambeau always flung as he walked,\\nand which now stood upright beside his tall mug of Munich.\\nNay, in his sleepy irresponsibility, he even found himself eyeing the\\nknobbed and clumsy head of his own shabby umbrella, with some\\nfaint memories of the ogre\\'s club in a coloured toy-book.\\nBut he never composed anything in the form of fiction, unless it be\\nthe tale that follows:\\n\\n     \"I wonder,\" he said, \"whether one would have real adventures\\nin a place like this, if one put oneself in the way?  It\\'s a splendid\\nback-scene for them, but I always have a kind of feeling that they\\nwould fight you with pasteboard sabres more than real, horrible swords.\"\\n\\n     \"You are mistaken,\" said his friend.  \"In this place they\\nnot only fight with swords, but kill without swords.  And there\\'s\\nworse than that.\"\\n\\n     \"Why, what do you mean?\" asked Father Brown.\\n\\n     \"Why,\" replied the other, \"I should say this was the only place\\nin Europe where a man was ever shot without firearms.\"\\n\\n     \"Do you mean a bow and arrow?\" asked Brown in some wonder.\\n\\n     \"I mean a bullet in the brain,\" replied Flambeau.\\n\"Don\\'t you know the story of the late Prince of this place?\\nIt was one of the great police mysteries about twenty years ago.\\nYou remember, of course, that this place was forcibly annexed\\nat the time of Bismarck\\'s very earliest schemes of consolidation--\\nforcibly, that is, but not at all easily.  The empire (or what wanted\\nto be one) sent Prince Otto of Grossenmark to rule the place\\nin the Imperial interests.  We saw his portrait in the gallery there--\\na handsome old gentleman if he\\'d had any hair or eyebrows,\\nand hadn\\'t been wrinkled all over like a vulture; but he had\\nthings to harass him, as I\\'ll explain in a minute.  He was a soldier\\nof distinguished skill and success, but he didn\\'t have altogether\\nan easy job with this little place.  He was defeated in several battles\\nby the celebrated Arnhold brothers--the three guerrilla patriots\\nto whom Swinburne wrote a poem, you remember:\\n\\n        Wolves with the hair of the ermine,\\n          Crows that are crowned and kings--\\n        These things be many as vermin,\\n          Yet Three shall abide these things.\\n\\nOr something of that kind.  Indeed, it is by no means certain\\nthat the occupation would ever have been successful had not one of\\nthe three brothers, Paul, despicably, but very decisively declined\\nto abide these things any longer, and, by surrendering all the secrets\\nof the insurrection, ensured its overthrow and his own ultimate promotion\\nto the post of chamberlain to Prince Otto.  After this, Ludwig,\\nthe one genuine hero among Mr Swinburne\\'s heroes, was killed,\\nsword in hand, in the capture of the city; and the third, Heinrich,\\nwho, though not a traitor, had always been tame and even timid\\ncompared with his active brothers, retired into something like a hermitage,\\nbecame converted to a Christian quietism which was almost Quakerish,\\nand never mixed with men except to give nearly all he had to the poor.\\nThey tell me that not long ago he could still be seen about\\nthe neighbourhood occasionally, a man in a black cloak, nearly blind,\\nwith very wild, white hair, but a face of astonishing softness.\"\\n\\n     \"I know,\" said Father Brown.  \"I saw him once.\"\\n\\n     His friend looked at him in some surprise.  \"I didn\\'t know\\nyou\\'d been here before,\" he said.  \"Perhaps you know as much about it\\nas I do.  Anyhow, that\\'s the story of the Arnholds, and he was\\nthe last survivor of them.  Yes, and of all the men who played parts\\nin that drama.\"\\n\\n     \"You mean that the Prince, too, died long before?\"\\n\\n     \"Died,\" repeated Flambeau, \"and that\\'s about as much as we can say.\\nYou must understand that towards the end of his life he began\\nto have those tricks of the nerves not uncommon with tyrants.\\nHe multiplied the ordinary daily and nightly guard round his castle\\ntill there seemed to be more sentry-boxes than houses in the town,\\nand doubtful characters were shot without mercy.  He lived almost entirely\\nin a little room that was in the very centre of the enormous labyrinth\\nof all the other rooms, and even in this he erected another sort of\\ncentral cabin or cupboard, lined with steel, like a safe or a battleship.\\nSome say that under the floor of this again was a secret hole in the earth,\\nno more than large enough to hold him, so that, in his anxiety\\nto avoid the grave, he was willing to go into a place pretty much like it.\\nBut he went further yet.  The populace had been supposed to be disarmed\\never since the suppression of the revolt, but Otto now insisted,\\nas governments very seldom insist, on an absolute and literal disarmament.\\nIt was carried out, with extraordinary thoroughness and severity,\\nby very well-organized officials over a small and familiar area, and,\\nso far as human strength and science can be absolutely certain of anything,\\nPrince Otto was absolutely certain that nobody could introduce so much as\\na toy pistol into Heiligwaldenstein.\"\\n\\n     \"Human science can never be quite certain of things like that,\"\\nsaid Father Brown, still looking at the red budding of the branches\\nover his head, \"if only because of the difficulty about definition\\nand connotation.  What is a weapon?  People have been murdered\\nwith the mildest domestic comforts; certainly with tea-kettles,\\nprobably with tea-cosies.  On the other hand, if you showed\\nan Ancient Briton a revolver, I doubt if he would know it was a weapon--\\nuntil it was fired into him, of course.  Perhaps somebody introduced\\na firearm so new that it didn\\'t even look like a firearm.\\nPerhaps it looked like a thimble or something.  Was the bullet\\nat all peculiar?\"\\n\\n     \"Not that I ever heard of,\" answered Flambeau; \"but my information\\nis fragmentary, and only comes from my old friend Grimm.\\nHe was a very able detective in the German service, and he tried\\nto arrest me; I arrested him instead, and we had many interesting chats.\\nHe was in charge here of the inquiry about Prince Otto, but I forgot\\nto ask him anything about the bullet.  According to Grimm,\\nwhat happened was this.\"  He paused a moment to drain the greater part\\nof his dark lager at a draught, and then resumed:\\n\\n     \"On the evening in question, it seems, the Prince was expected\\nto appear in one of the outer rooms, because he had to receive\\ncertain visitors whom he really wished to meet.  They were geological\\nexperts sent to investigate the old question of the alleged supply of gold\\nfrom the rocks round here, upon which (as it was said) the small city-state\\nhad so long maintained its credit and been able to negotiate with\\nits neighbours even under the ceaseless bombardment of bigger armies.\\nHitherto it had never been found by the most exacting inquiry\\nwhich could--\"\\n\\n     \"Which could be quite certain of discovering a toy pistol,\"\\nsaid Father Brown with a smile.  \"But what about the brother who ratted?\\nHadn\\'t he anything to tell the Prince?\"\\n\\n     \"He always asseverated that he did not know,\" replied Flambeau;\\n\"that this was the one secret his brothers had not told him.\\nIt is only right to say that it received some support from\\nfragmentary words--spoken by the great Ludwig in the hour of death,\\nwhen he looked at Heinrich but pointed at Paul, and said,\\n`You have not told him...\\' and was soon afterwards incapable of speech.\\nAnyhow, the deputation of distinguished geologists and mineralogists\\nfrom Paris and Berlin were there in the most magnificent and\\nappropriate dress, for there are no men who like wearing their decorations\\nso much as the men of science--as anybody knows who has ever been to\\na soiree of the Royal Society.  It was a brilliant gathering,\\nbut very late, and gradually the Chamberlain--you saw his portrait, too:\\na man with black eyebrows, serious eyes, and a meaningless sort of\\nsmile underneath--the Chamberlain, I say, discovered there was\\neverything there except the Prince himself.  He searched all the\\nouter salons; then, remembering the man\\'s mad fits of fear,\\nhurried to the inmost chamber.  That also was empty, but the steel turret\\nor cabin erected in the middle of it took some time to open.\\nWhen it did open it was empty, too.  He went and looked into\\nthe hole in the ground, which seemed deeper and somehow all the more\\nlike a grave--that is his account, of course.  And even as he did so\\nhe heard a burst of cries and tumult in the long rooms\\nand corridors without.\\n\\n     \"First it was a distant din and thrill of something unthinkable\\non the horizon of the crowd, even beyond the castle.  Next it was\\na wordless clamour startlingly close, and loud enough to be distinct\\nif each word had not killed the other.  Next came words\\nof a terrible clearness, coming nearer, and next one man,\\nrushing into the room and telling the news as briefly as such news is told.\\n\\n     \"Otto, Prince of Heiligwaldenstein and Grossenmark, was lying\\nin the dews of the darkening twilight in the woods beyond the castle,\\nwith his arms flung out and his face flung up to the moon.\\nThe blood still pulsed from his shattered temple and jaw,\\nbut it was the only part of him that moved like a living thing.\\nHe was clad in his full white and yellow uniform, as to receive his\\nguests within, except that the sash or scarf had been unbound and lay\\nrather crumpled by his side.  Before he could be lifted he was dead.\\nBut, dead or alive, he was a riddle--he who had always hidden in\\nthe inmost chamber out there in the wet woods, unarmed and alone.\"\\n\\n     \"Who found his body?\" asked Father Brown.\\n\\n     \"Some girl attached to the Court named Hedwig von something or other,\"\\nreplied his friend, \"who had been out in the wood picking wild flowers.\"\\n\\n     \"Had she picked any?\" asked the priest, staring rather vacantly\\nat the veil of the branches above him.\\n\\n     \"Yes,\" replied Flambeau.  \"I particularly remember that\\nthe Chamberlain, or old Grimm or somebody, said how horrible it was,\\nwhen they came up at her call, to see a girl holding spring flowers\\nand bending over that--that bloody collapse.  However, the main point is\\nthat before help arrived he was dead, and the news, of course,\\nhad to be carried back to the castle.  The consternation it created was\\nsomething beyond even that natural in a Court at the fall of a potentate.\\nThe foreign visitors, especially the mining experts, were in the wildest\\ndoubt and excitement, as well as many important Prussian officials,\\nand it soon began to be clear that the scheme for finding the treasure\\nbulked much bigger in the business than people had supposed.\\nExperts and officials had been promised great prizes or\\ninternational advantages, and some even said that the Prince\\'s\\nsecret apartments and strong military protection were due less to fear\\nof the populace than to the pursuit of some private investigation of--\"\\n\\n     \"Had the flowers got long stalks?\" asked Father Brown.\\n\\n     Flambeau stared at him.  \"What an odd person you are!\" he said.\\n\"That\\'s exactly what old Grimm said.  He said the ugliest part of it,\\nhe thought--uglier than the blood and bullet--was that the flowers\\nwere quite short, plucked close under the head.\"\\n\\n     \"Of course,\" said the priest, \"when a grown up girl is really\\npicking flowers, she picks them with plenty of stalk.  If she just\\npulled their heads off, as a child does, it looks as if--\"\\nAnd he hesitated.\\n\\n     \"Well?\" inquired the other.\\n\\n     \"Well, it looks rather as if she had snatched them nervously,\\nto make an excuse for being there after--well, after she was there.\"\\n\\n     \"I know what you\\'re driving at,\" said Flambeau rather gloomily.\\n\"But that and every other suspicion breaks down on the one point--\\nthe want of a weapon.  He could have been killed, as you say,\\nwith lots of other things--even with his own military sash;\\nbut we have to explain not bow he was killed, but how he was shot.\\nAnd the fact is we can\\'t.  They had the girl most ruthlessly searched;\\nfor, to tell the truth, she was a little suspect, though the niece\\nand ward of the wicked old Chamberlain, Paul Arnhold.  But she was\\nvery romantic, and was suspected of sympathy with the old revolutionary\\nenthusiasm in her family.  All the same, however romantic you are,\\nyou can\\'t imagine a big bullet into a man\\'s jaw or brain without using\\na gun or pistol.  And there was no pistol, though there were\\ntwo pistol shots.  I leave it to you, my friend.\"\\n\\n     \"How do you know there were two shots?\" asked the little priest.\\n\\n     \"There was only one in his head,\" said his companion,\\n\"but there was another bullet-hole in the sash.\"\\n\\n     Father Brown\\'s smooth brow became suddenly constricted.\\n\"Was the other bullet found?\" he demanded.\\n\\n     Flambeau started a little.  \"I don\\'t think I remember,\" he said.\\n\\n     \"Hold on!  Hold on!  Hold on!\" cried Brown, frowning more and more,\\nwith a quite unusual concentration of curiosity.  \"Don\\'t think me rude.\\nLet me think this out for a moment.\"\\n\\n     \"All right,\" said Flambeau, laughing, and finished his beer.\\nA slight breeze stirred the budding trees and blew up into the sky\\ncloudlets of white and pink that seemed to make the sky bluer and\\nthe whole coloured scene more quaint.  They might have been cherubs\\nflying home to the casements of a sort of celestial nursery.\\nThe oldest tower of the castle, the Dragon Tower, stood up as grotesque\\nas the ale-mug, but as homely.  Only beyond the tower glimmered\\nthe wood in which the man had lain dead.\\n\\n     \"What became of this Hedwig eventually?\" asked the priest at last.\\n\\n     \"She is married to General Schwartz,\" said Flambeau.\\n\"No doubt you\\'ve heard of his career, which was rather romantic.\\nHe had distinguished himself even, before his exploits at Sadowa\\nand Gravelotte; in fact, he rose from the ranks, which is very unusual\\neven in the smallest of the German...\"\\n\\n     Father Brown sat up suddenly.\\n\\n     \"Rose from the ranks!\" he cried, and made a mouth as if to whistle.\\n\"Well, well, what a queer story!  What a queer way of killing a man;\\nbut I suppose it was the only one possible.  But to think of hate\\nso patient--\"\\n\\n     \"What do you mean?\" demanded the other.  \"In what way did they\\nkill the man?\"\\n\\n     \"They killed him with the sash,\" said Brown carefully; and then,\\nas Flambeau protested:  \"Yes, yes, I know about the bullet.\\nPerhaps I ought to say he died of having a sash.  I know it doesn\\'t sound\\nlike having a disease.\"\\n\\n     \"I suppose,\" said Flambeau, \"that you\\'ve got some notion\\nin your head, but it won\\'t easily get the bullet out of his.\\nAs I explained before, he might easily have been strangled.\\nBut he was shot.  By whom?  By what?\"\\n\\n     \"He was shot by his own orders,\" said the priest.\\n\\n     \"You mean he committed suicide?\"\\n\\n     \"I didn\\'t say by his own wish,\" replied Father Brown.\\n\"I said by his own orders.\"\\n\\n     \"Well, anyhow, what is your theory?\"\\n\\n     Father Brown laughed.  \"I am only on my holiday,\" he said.\\n\"I haven\\'t got any theories.  Only this place reminds me of fairy stories,\\nand, if you like, I\\'ll tell you a story.\"\\n\\n     The little pink clouds, that looked rather like sweet-stuff,\\nhad floated up to crown the turrets of the gilt gingerbread castle,\\nand the pink baby fingers of the budding trees seemed spreading and\\nstretching to reach them; the blue sky began to take a bright violet\\nof evening, when Father Brown suddenly spoke again:\\n\\n     \"It was on a dismal night, with rain still dropping from the trees\\nand dew already clustering, that Prince Otto of Grossenmark stepped\\nhurriedly out of a side door of the castle and walked swiftly\\ninto the wood.  One of the innumerable sentries saluted him,\\nbut he did not notice it.  He had no wish to be specially noticed himself.\\nHe was glad when the great trees, grey and already greasy with rain,\\nswallowed him up like a swamp.  He had deliberately chosen\\nthe least frequented side of his palace, but even that was more frequented\\nthan he liked.  But there was no particular chance of officious\\nor diplomatic pursuit, for his exit had been a sudden impulse.\\nAll the full-dressed diplomatists he left behind were unimportant.\\nHe had realized suddenly that he could do without them.\\n\\n     \"His great passion was not the much nobler dread of death,\\nbut the strange desire of gold.  For this legend of the gold he had\\nleft Grossenmark and invaded Heiligwaldenstein.  For this and only this\\nhe had bought the traitor and butchered the hero, for this he had\\nlong questioned and cross-questioned the false Chamberlain,\\nuntil he had come to the conclusion that, touching his ignorance,\\nthe renegade really told the truth.  For this he had, somewhat reluctantly,\\npaid and promised money on the chance of gaining the larger amount;\\nand for this he had stolen out of his palace like a thief in the rain,\\nfor he had thought of another way to get the desire of his eyes,\\nand to get it cheap.\\n\\n     \"Away at the upper end of a rambling mountain path to which\\nhe was making his way, among the pillared rocks along the ridge\\nthat hangs above the town, stood the hermitage, hardly more than\\na cavern fenced with thorn, in which the third of the great brethren\\nhad long hidden himself from the world.  He, thought Prince Otto,\\ncould have no real reason for refusing to give up the gold.\\nHe had known its place for years, and made no effort to find it,\\neven before his new ascetic creed had cut him off from property\\nor pleasures.  True, he had been an enemy, but he now professed\\na duty of having no enemies.  Some concession to his cause,\\nsome appeal to his principles, would probably get the mere money secret\\nout of him.  Otto was no coward, in spite of his network of military\\nprecautions, and, in any case, his avarice was stronger than his fears.\\nNor was there much cause for fear.  Since he was certain there were\\nno private arms in the whole principality, he was a hundred times\\nmore certain there were none in the Quaker\\'s little hermitage on the hill,\\nwhere he lived on herbs, with two old rustic servants, and with\\nno other voice of man for year after year.  Prince Otto looked down\\nwith something of a grim smile at the bright, square labyrinths\\nof the lamp-lit city below him.  For as far as the eye could see\\nthere ran the rifles of his friends, and not one pinch of powder\\nfor his enemies.  Rifles ranked so close even to that mountain path\\nthat a cry from him would bring the soldiers rushing up the hill,\\nto say nothing of the fact that the wood and ridge were patrolled\\nat regular intervals; rifles so far away, in the dim woods,\\ndwarfed by distance, beyond the river, that an enemy could not\\nslink into the town by any detour.  And round the palace rifles\\nat the west door and the east door, at the north door and the south,\\nand all along the four facades linking them.  He was safe.\\n\\n     \"It was all the more clear when he had crested the ridge\\nand found how naked was the nest of his old enemy.  He found himself\\non a small platform of rock, broken abruptly by the three corners\\nof precipice.  Behind was the black cave, masked with green thorn,\\nso low that it was hard to believe that a man could enter it.\\nIn front was the fall of the cliffs and the vast but cloudy\\nvision of the valley.  On the small rock platform stood\\nan old bronze lectern or reading-stand, groaning under a great German Bible.\\nThe bronze or copper of it had grown green with the eating airs\\nof that exalted place, and Otto had instantly the thought,\\n\"Even if they had arms, they must be rusted by now.\" Moonrise had already\\nmade a deathly dawn behind the crests and crags, and the rain had ceased.\\n\\n     \"Behind the lectern, and looking across the valley,\\nstood a very old man in a black robe that fell as straight as\\nthe cliffs around him, but whose white hair and weak voice seemed alike\\nto waver in the wind.  He was evidently reading some daily lesson\\nas part of his religious exercises.  \"They trust in their horses...\"\\n\\n     \"`Sir,\\' said the Prince of Heiligwaldenstein, with quite unusual\\ncourtesy, `I should like only one word with you.\\'\\n\\n     \"`...and in their chariots,\\' went on the old man weakly,\\n`but we will trust in the name of the Lord of Hosts....\\'\\nHis last words were inaudible, but he closed the book reverently and,\\nbeing nearly blind, made a groping movement and gripped the reading-stand.\\nInstantly his two servants slipped out of the low-browed cavern\\nand supported him.  They wore dull-black gowns like his own,\\nbut they had not the frosty silver on the hair, nor the frost-bitten\\nrefinement of the features.  They were peasants, Croat or Magyar,\\nwith broad, blunt visages and blinking eyes.  For the first time\\nsomething troubled the Prince, but his courage and diplomatic sense\\nstood firm.\\n\\n     \"`I fear we have not met,\\' he said, `since that awful cannonade\\nin which your poor brother died.\\'\\n\\n     \"`All my brothers died,\\' said the old man, still looking\\nacross the valley.  Then, for one instant turning on Otto his drooping,\\ndelicate features, and the wintry hair that seemed to drip\\nover his eyebrows like icicles, he added:  `You see, I am dead, too.\\'\\n\\n     \"`I hope you\\'ll understand,\\' said the Prince, controlling himself\\nalmost to a point of conciliation, `that I do not come here to haunt you,\\nas a mere ghost of those great quarrels.  We will not talk about\\nwho was right or wrong in that, but at least there was one point\\non which we were never wrong, because you were always right.\\nWhatever is to be said of the policy of your family, no one for one moment\\nimagines that you were moved by the mere gold; you have proved yourself\\nabove the suspicion that...\\'\\n\\n     \"The old man in the black gown had hitherto continued to gaze at him\\nwith watery blue eyes and a sort of weak wisdom in his face.\\nBut when the word `gold\\' was said he held out his hand as if\\nin arrest of something, and turned away his face to the mountains.\\n\\n     \"`He has spoken of gold,\\' he said.  `He has spoken of\\nthings not lawful.  Let him cease to speak.\\'\\n\\n     \"Otto had the vice of his Prussian type and tradition,\\nwhich is to regard success not as an incident but as a quality.\\nHe conceived himself and his like as perpetually conquering peoples\\nwho were perpetually being conquered.  Consequently, he was ill acquainted\\nwith the emotion of surprise, and ill prepared for the next movement,\\nwhich startled and stiffened him.  He had opened his mouth\\nto answer the hermit, when the mouth was stopped and the voice\\nstrangled by a strong, soft gag suddenly twisted round his head\\nlike a tourniquet.  It was fully forty seconds before he even realized\\nthat the two Hungarian servants had done it, and that they had done it\\nwith his own military scarf.\\n\\n     \"The old man went again weakly to his great brazen-supported Bible,\\nturned over the leaves, with a patience that had something horrible\\nabout it, till he came to the Epistle of St James, and then began to read:\\n`The tongue is a little member, but--\\'\\n\\n     \"Something in the very voice made the Prince turn suddenly\\nand plunge down the mountain-path he had climbed.  He was half-way towards\\nthe gardens of the palace before he even tried to tear the strangling scarf\\nfrom his neck and jaws.  He tried again and again, and it was impossible;\\nthe men who had knotted that gag knew the difference between\\nwhat a man can do with his hands in front of him and what he can do\\nwith his hands behind his head.  His legs were free to leap like\\nan antelope on the mountains, his arms were free to use any gesture\\nor wave any signal, but he could not speak.  A dumb devil was in him.\\n\\n     \"He had come close to the woods that walled in the castle\\nbefore he had quite realized what his wordless state meant\\nand was meant to mean.  Once more he looked down grimly at the bright,\\nsquare labyrinths of the lamp-lit city below him, and he smiled no more.\\nHe felt himself repeating the phrases of his former mood with\\na murderous irony.  Far as the eye could see ran the rifles\\nof his friends, every one of whom would shoot him dead\\nif he could not answer the challenge.  Rifles were so near that\\nthe wood and ridge could be patrolled at regular intervals;\\ntherefore it was useless to hide in the wood till morning.\\nRifles were ranked so far away that an enemy could not slink\\ninto the town by any detour; therefore it was vain to return to the city\\nby any remote course.  A cry from him would bring his soldiers\\nrushing up the hill.  But from him no cry would come.\\n\\n     \"The moon had risen in strengthening silver, and the sky showed\\nin stripes of bright, nocturnal blue between the black stripes\\nof the pines about the castle.  Flowers of some wide and feathery sort--\\nfor he had never noticed such things before--were at once luminous\\nand discoloured by the moonshine, and seemed indescribably fantastic\\nas they clustered, as if crawling about the roots of the trees.\\nPerhaps his reason had been suddenly unseated by the unnatural captivity\\nhe carried with him, but in that wood he felt something\\nunfathomably German--the fairy tale.  He knew with half his mind\\nthat he was drawing near to the castle of an ogre--he had forgotten\\nthat he was the ogre.  He remembered asking his mother if bears lived\\nin the old park at home.  He stooped to pick a flower, as if it were\\na charm against enchantment.  The stalk was stronger than he expected,\\nand broke with a slight snap.  Carefully trying to place it in his scarf,\\nhe heard the halloo, `Who goes there?\\' Then he remembered the scarf\\nwas not in its usual place.\\n\\n     \"He tried to scream and was silent.  The second challenge came;\\nand then a shot that shrieked as it came and then was stilled suddenly\\nby impact.  Otto of Grossenmark lay very peacefully among the fairy\\ntrees, and would do no more harm either with gold or steel; only the\\nsilver pencil of the moon would pick out and trace here and there the\\nintricate ornament of his uniform, or the old wrinkles on his brow.\\nMay God have mercy on his soul.\\n\\n     \"The sentry who had fired, according to the strict orders\\nof the garrison, naturally ran forward to find some trace of his quarry.\\nHe was a private named Schwartz, since not unknown in his profession,\\nand what he found was a bald man in uniform, but with his face\\nso bandaged by a kind of mask made of his own military scarf\\nthat nothing but open, dead eyes could be seen, glittering stonily\\nin the moonlight.  The bullet had gone through the gag into the jaw;\\nthat is why there was a shot-hole in the scarf, but only one shot.\\nNaturally, if not correctly, young Schwartz tore off the mysterious\\nsilken mask and cast it on the grass; and then he saw whom he had slain.\\n\\n     \"We cannot be certain of the next phase.  But I incline to believe\\nthat there was a fairy tale, after all, in that little wood,\\nhorrible as was its occasion.  Whether the young lady named Hedwig\\nhad any previous knowledge of the soldier she saved and eventually married,\\nor whether she came accidentally upon the accident and their intimacy\\nbegan that night, we shall probably never know.  But we can know,\\nI fancy, that this Hedwig was a heroine, and deserved to marry a man\\nwho became something of a hero.  She did the bold and the wise thing.\\nShe persuaded the sentry to go back to his post, in which place\\nthere was nothing to connect him with the disaster; he was but one of\\nthe most loyal and orderly of fifty such sentries within call.\\nShe remained by the body and gave the alarm; and there was nothing\\nto connect her with the disaster either, since she had not got,\\nand could not have, any firearms.\\n\\n     \"Well,\" said Father Brown rising cheerfully \"I hope they\\'re happy.\"\\n\\n     \"Where are you going?\" asked his friend.\\n\\n     \"I\\'m going to have another look at that portrait of the Chamberlain,\\nthe Arnhold who betrayed his brethren,\" answered the priest.\\n\"I wonder what part--I wonder if a man is less a traitor when he is\\ntwice a traitor?\"\\n\\n     And he ruminated long before the portrait of a white-haired man\\nwith black eyebrows and a pink, painted sort of smile that seemed\\nto contradict the black warning in his eyes.\\n\\n'"

    "Zipf's Law states that the relative frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank. Here we can observe the same. In our code we took the frequency of each word and sorted them in the descending order. Initially we can see at lowest rank the frequency of word occurancy is very high. As we keep increasing the rank the frequency keep decreasing."
